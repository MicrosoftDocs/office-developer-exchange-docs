# Excludes

The **Excludes** element performs a bitwise mask of the specified property and a supplied value. 
  
```xml
<Excludes>
   <FieldURI/>
   <Bitmask/>
</Excludes>
```

```xml
<Excludes>
   <ExtendedFieldURI/> 
   <Bitmask/>
</Excludes>
```

```xml
<Excludes>
   <IndexedFieldURI/> 
   <Bitmask/>
</Excludes>
```

**ExcludesType**

## Attributes and elements

The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.
  
### Attributes

None.
  
### Child elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[FieldURI](fielduri.md) <br/> |Identifies frequently referenced properties by URI.  <br/> |
|[IndexedFieldURI](indexedfielduri.md) <br/> |Identifies individual members of a dictionary.  <br/> |
|[ExtendedFieldURI](extendedfielduri.md) <br/> |Identifies MAPI properties.  <br/> |
|[Bitmask](bitmask.md) <br/> |Represents a hexadecimal or decimal mask to be used during an [Excludes](excludes.md) restriction operation. If the bitmask represents a hexadecimal number, it must be prefixed by 0x or 0X. Otherwise, it will be considered a decimal number.  <br/> |
   
### Parent elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[Restriction](restriction.md) <br/> |Represents the restriction or query that is used to filter items or folders in FindItem/FindFolder and search folder operations.  <br/> |
|[Not](not.md) <br/> |Represents a search expression that negates the Boolean value of the search expression that it contains.  <br/> |
|[And](and.md) <br/> |Represents a search expression that allows you to perform a Boolean And operation between two or more search expressions. The result of the And operation is **true** if all of the search expressions contained within the And are **true**.  <br/> |
|[Or](or.md) <br/> |Represents a search expression that performs a logical OR on the search expression it contains. The [Or](or.md) element will return **true** if any of its children return **true**.  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

**Excludes** will resolve to **true** if an AND operation performed on the following resolves to 0: 
  
1. The bitwise value for the property
    
2. The bitmask value for the property
    
**Excludes** can only be applied to a property that has an integer value. If the property type is anything other than an integer, an error code of **ErrorUnsupportedPathForQuery** is returned in the response. 
  
You can perform the reverse operation by calling Not(Excludes).
