### Comments

The CreateAttachment operation returns an element of AttachmentIdType type that includes a **RootItemId** and **RootItemChangeKey**. These attributes are not permitted for identifiers within a DeleteAttachment request. DeleteAttachment uses elements of type RequestAttachmentIdType, which does not include these attributes.
  
The DeleteAttachment response includes the ID of the parent item. When attachments are removed from an item, the item's change key is modified. The new item change key can be obtained from the DeleteAttachment response.
  
> [!NOTE]
> The [RootItemId](rootitemid.md) identifier and ChangeKey have been shortened to preserve readability. 
  
### Successful response elements

The following elements are used in the response:
  
- [ServerVersionInfo](serverversioninfo.md)
    
- [DeleteAttachmentResponse](deleteattachmentresponse.md)
    
- [ResponseMessages](responsemessages.md)
    
- [DeleteAttachmentResponseMessage](deleteattachmentresponsemessage.md)
    
- [ResponseCode](responsecode.md)
