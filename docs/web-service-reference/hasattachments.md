## Text value

A text value that represents a Boolean value is required. A value of **true** means that the item or conversation has at least one visible attachment. A value of **false** means that the item or conversation either has no attachments or has only hidden attachments. 
  
## Remarks

The **HasAttachments** property is calculated from the Boolean **AllAttachmentsHidden** MAPI property. If an item does not have an attachment, the **AllAttachmentsHidden** property does not exist. If all the attachments on the item are hidden, the **AllAttachmentsHidden** property is **true**. The **AllAttachmentsHidden** property is **false** if it has at least one attachment and at least one of the attachments is visible. Use the **AllAttachmentsHidden** MAPI property for searching, grouping, and sorting items. 
  
The schema that describes this element is located in the IIS virtual directory that hosts Exchange Web Services.
