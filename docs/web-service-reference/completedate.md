# CompleteDate

The **CompleteDate** element represents the date on which an item was completed. 
  
```xml
<CompleteDate/>
```

 **DateTime**
## Attributes and elements

The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.
  
### Attributes

None.
  
### Child elements

None.
  
### Parent elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[Task](task.md) <br/> |Represents a task in the Exchange store.  <br/> |
|[Flag](flag.md) <br/> |Specifies a flag on a mailbox item.  <br/> |
   
## Text value

A text value that represents the date and time is required if this element is used.
  
## Remarks

Setting **CompleteDate** has the same effect as setting [PercentComplete](percentcomplete.md) to 100 or [Status](status.md) to **Completed**. In a request that sets at least two of these properties, the last processed property will determine the value that is set for these elements. For example, if [PercentComplete](percentcomplete.md) is 100, **CompleteDate** is January 1, 2007, and [Status](status.md) is **NotStarted**, and the properties are streamed in that order, the effect will be to set the [Status](status.md) of the task to **NotStarted**, the [CompleteDate](completedate.md) to **null**, and [PercentComplete](percentcomplete.md) to 0. 
  
The schema that describes this element is located in the EWS virtual directory of the computer that is running MicrosoftExchange Server 2007 that has the Client Access server role installed.
