# Unified Messaging web service reference for Exchange

Find reference content for the Unified Messaging (UM) web service in Exchange.
  
The Unified Messaging (UM) web service provides an extensibility point that enables clients to read and change information about UM properties and request that mailbox store items be parsed and dictated over a telephony device. This section contains information about the operations and elements that make up the XML messages for the UM web service. This content applies to the service endpoint URL that is similar to https://\<yourclientaccessserver\>.com/EWS/UM2007Legacy.asmx. 
  
You can use the Autodiscover service to get the URL to the UM web service endpoint. For more information about Autodiscover, see [Autodiscover for Exchange](../exchange-web-services/autodiscover-for-exchange.md).
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For versions of Exchange starting with Exchange 2010, we recommend that you use the Unified Messaging operations that are available in [Exchange Web Services (EWS)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/60285497-0c4e-4e51-84e1-34dd6d89a5d8%28Office.15%29.aspx) instead of the UM web service, for the following reasons: 
> - The EWS-based UM features have first-class support in the EWS Managed API. 
> - In versions of Exchange starting with Exchange 2010, new UM features are added to EWS but not to the Unified Messaging web service. 
  
The UM web service does not have an explicit schema.
