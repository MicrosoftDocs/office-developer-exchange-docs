## Text value

The text value specifies the SSL certificate principal name that is required to connect to the Microsoft Exchange organization by using SSL.
  
## Remarks

If the **CertPrincipalName** element is not specified, the default is set to msstd:SERVER, where SERVER is the value that is specified in the [Server (POX)](server-pox.md) element. For example, if SERVER is specified as example.com and **CertPrincipalName** is left blank with [SSL (POX)](ssl-pox.md) turned on, the default value of **CertPrincipalName** would be msstd:example.com. 
  
If **none** is specified, Windows will validate the certificate principal name according to information found in the [Principal Names](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=93417) topic on MSDN.
