## Remarks

The [From](from.md) element should be set to the e-mail address of the principal if an item is a reply by a delegate. If the delegate does not set the [From](from.md) property, the item will appear to have been sent directly from the delegate's mailbox. 
  
The schema that describes this element is located in the EWS virtual directory of the computer that is running Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 that has the Client Access server role installed.
