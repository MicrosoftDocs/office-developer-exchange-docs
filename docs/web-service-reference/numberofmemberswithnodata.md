## Remarks

A contact in a group who does not have a mailbox is an example of a distribution list member who does not have calendar data. A contact may also have **No Data** status for the following reasons: 
  
- Permissions are insufficient.
    
- The distribution list is too large to expand.
    
- The Active Directory directory service is unavailable.
