Exchange Web Services only supports simple contains filters against the attachment table. If you try to bind to an existing search folder that has a more complex attachment table restriction (a subfilter), Exchange Web Services cannot render the XML for that filter and returns this response code. <br/> Note that you can still call the GetFolder operation on the folder, but do not request the [SearchParameters](searchparameters.md) element. |

|ErrorInvalidDelegatePermission |This error indicates that the specified folder permissions are invalid. |
|ErrorInvalidDelegateUserId |This error indicates that the specified delegate user ID is invalid. |
|ErrorInvalidExchangeImpersonationHeaderData |This error occurs during Exchange Impersonation when a caller does not specify a UPN, an e-mail address, or a user SID. This will also occur if the caller specifies one or more of those and the values are empty. |

For example, this error occurs if the [IsRead](isread.md) or [IsFromMe](isfromme.md) flags are specified in the [Exists](exists.md) element. The request should use the [IsEqualTo](isequalto.md) element instead for these as they are flags and therefore part of a single property. |
