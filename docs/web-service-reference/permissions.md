# Permissions

The **Permissions** element contains the collection of permissions for a folder. 
  
```XML
<Permissions>
   <Permission/>
</Permissions>
```

 **PermissionType**
## Attributes and elements

The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.
  
### Attributes

None.
  
### Child elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[Permission](permission.md) <br/> |Defines the access that a delegate has to a folder. This element was introduced in Exchange 2007 SP1.  <br/> |
   
### Parent elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[PermissionSet (PermissionSetType)](permissionset-permissionsettype.md) <br/> |Contains all the permissions that are configured for a folder. This element was introduced in Exchange 2007 SP1.  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

The schema that describes this element is located in the IIS virtual directory that hosts Exchange Web Services.
  
This element was introduced in Exchange Server 2007 Service Pack 1 (SP1).
  
### Version differences

For applications that target Exchange Online, Exchange Online as part of Office 365, or an on-premises version of Exchange starting with Exchange 2013, folder permissions are not returned when the [BaseShape](baseshape.md) element has a value of **AllProperties** in the [GetFolder](getfolder-operation.md) operation request. To retrieve folder permissions, add the [PermissionSet (PermissionSetType)](permissionset-permissionsettype.md) element to the [AdditionalProperties](additionalproperties.md) element in the **GetFolder** request.
