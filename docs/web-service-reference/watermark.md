## Text value

A text value may be required or optional depending on how this element is used.
  
## Remarks

If a Subscribe request contains a watermark, the subscription is created from the watermark forward. If the Subscribe request contains a watermark that is not found in the mailbox events table, an  `ErrorInvalidWatermark` error is returned to the client application. This may occur if the watermark is too old and has been removed from the 30 day window of the events table or if the watermark was not ever present in the events table. This can happen, for example, if a watermark is obtained from a different subscription for a mailbox in a different database.
