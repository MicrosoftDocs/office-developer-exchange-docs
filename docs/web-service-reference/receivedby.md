## Remarks

The **ReceivedRepresenting** element is used together with the **From** and **ReceivedBy** elements in delegate access scenarios. The following table lists the entities that these elements represent in a delegate access scenario. 
  
**Elements in a delegate access scenario**

|**Element**|**Entity that the element represent**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[From](from.md) <br/> |ThirdParty  <br/> |
|[ReceivedBy](receivedby.md) <br/> |Delegate  <br/> |
|[ReceivedRepresenting](receivedrepresenting.md) <br/> |Principal  <br/> |
   
In a delegate access scenario, if a ThirdParty sends a meeting request to a Principal who has a Delegate, the Delegate will see a new meeting request. These elements enable delegates to distinguish between messages that are sent directly to them and messages that are sent to them because of a delegate forwarding rule.
  
The schema that describes this element is located in the IIS virtual directory that hosts Exchange Web Services.
