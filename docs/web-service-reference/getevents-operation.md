# GetEvents operation

The **GetEvents** operation is used by pull subscription clients to request notifications from the Client Access server. The **GetEvents** operation response returns an array of items and events that have occurred in a mailbox since the last the notification. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **DeleteUserConfiguration** operation will trigger a move event for the event notification system. The user configuration object will be moved to the dumpster. 
  
## Notes

Changes to Calendar items may result in the generation of multiple events. These events are the result of temporary items being created in the mailbox, free/busy data storage items being changed as part of the normal Calendar operations, or both. Events for item class "IPM.SchedulePlus.FreeBusy.BinaryData" should be ignored by Web service clients. These temporary items are deleted after they are created; therefore, if an attempt is made to retrieve these items, an error will be returned that states that the item was not found.

## Remarks

When processing a **GetEvents** request, the Client Access server performs the following steps: 
  
1. The SubscriptionID of the request is confirmed to be a valid subscription that is hosted on the Client Access server. If it is not, the **GetEvents** call fails. 
    
2. The SMTP address of the authenticated user for the request is compared to the SMTP address of the user who created the subscription. If they do not match, the **GetEvents** request fails. 
    
3. The subscription queue is queried for events that are waiting to be sent to the client. If the queue is not empty, the first 50 events from the queue are pulled from the queue and encoded into a notification.
    
4. If no events are found in the queue, a StatusEvent is generated and encoded into a notification response.
    
5. The notification response is returned to the client.
    
6. The events that are included in the notification are removed from the subscription queue and the Client Access server local last watermark for the subscription is set to the watermark of the last event that is returned.
    
7. The timeout timer for the subscription is reset.
