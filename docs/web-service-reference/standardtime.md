# StandardTime

The **StandardTime** element represents an offset from the time relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) that is represented by the [Bias (UTC)](bias-utc.md) element. This element also contains information about the transition to standard time from daylight saving time in regions where daylight saving time is observed. 
  
- [TimeZone (Availability)](timezone-availability.md)
- [StandardTime](standardtime.md)
  
```xml
<StandardTime>
   <Bias>int</Bias>
   <Time>string</Time>
   <DayOrder>short</DayOrder>
   <Month>short</Month>
   <DayOfWeek>Sunday or Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday or Friday or Saturday</DayOfWeek>
   <Year>string</Year>
</StandardTime>
```

## Attributes and elements

The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.
  
### Attributes

None.
  
### Child elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[Bias](bias.md) <br/> |Represents the offset from the UTC offset that is identified by the [Bias (UTC)](bias-utc.md) element for standard time and daylight saving time. This value is in minutes.  <br/> |
|[Time](time.md) <br/> |Represents the transition time of day to and from standard time and daylight saving time.  <br/> |
|[DayOrder](dayorder.md) <br/> |Represents the  _n_th occurrence of the day that is specified in the [DayOfWeek (TimeZone)](dayofweek-timezone.md) element that represents the date of transition from and to standard time and daylight saving time.  <br/> |
|[Month](month.md) <br/> |Represents the transition month of the year to and from standard time and daylight saving time.  <br/> |
|[DayOfWeek (TimeZone)](dayofweek-timezone.md) <br/> |Represents the day of the week when the transition to and from standard time and daylight saving time occurs.  <br/> |
|[Year](year.md) <br/> |Defines a time zone that changes depending on the year. This element is optional. This element was introduced in Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 Service Pack 1 (SP1).  <br/> |
   
### Parent elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[TimeZone (Availability)](timezone-availability.md) <br/> | Contains elements that identify time zone information. This element also contains information about the transition between standard time and daylight saving time. <br/><br/>The following are the XPath expressions to this element: <br/> <br/>  `/GetUserAvailabilityResponse/FreeBusyResponseArray/FreeBusyResponse/FreeBusyView/WorkingHours/TimeZone` <br/> <br/> `/GetUserAvailabilityRequest/TimeZone` <br/> |
   
## Remarks

The **StandardTime** element represents an offset time that is represented by the [Bias (UTC)](bias-utc.md) element. When the child [Bias](bias.md) element equals 0, the standard time is equal to the bias offset from UTC that is represented by the [Bias (UTC)](bias-utc.md) element. 
  
## Example

The following example shows a region where daylight saving time is observed. The transition from daylight saving time to standard time is observed at 2 A.M. on the fifth Sunday of the tenth month.
  
```xml
<TimeZone xmlns="https://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types">
  <Bias>480</Bias>
  <StandardTime>
    <Bias>0</Bias>
    <Time>02:00:00</Time>
    <DayOrder>5</DayOrder>
    <Month>10</Month>
    <DayOfWeek>Sunday</DayOfWeek>
  </StandardTime>
  <DaylightTime>
    <Bias>-60</Bias>
    <Time>02:00:00</Time>
    <DayOrder>1</DayOrder>
    <Month>4</Month>
    <DayOfWeek>Sunday</DayOfWeek>
  </DaylightTime>
</TimeZone>
```
