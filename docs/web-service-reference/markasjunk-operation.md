# MarkAsJunk operation

Find information about the **MarkAsJunk** EWS operation. 
  
The **MarkAsJunk** operation adds and removes users from the blocked email list and moves email messages to the Junk Email folder. 
  
This operation was introduced in Exchange Server 2013.
  
## Using the MarkAsJunk operation

The **MarkAsJunk** operation contains two Boolean options to indicate whether an email sender should be added to the blocked sender list and whether the target email message should be moved to the default Junk Email folder or the Inbox folder. The actions are determined by the values of the **IsJunk** and **MoveItem** attributes. The following are the possible actions based on the value combinations for the **IsJunk** and **MoveItem** attributes: 
  
- If the **IsJunk** attribute is set to **true**, and the **MoveItem** attribute is set to **true**, the sender of the target email message is added to the blocked sender list and the email message is moved to the Junk Dmail folder.
    
- If the **IsJunk** attribute is set to **true**, and the **MoveItem** attribute is set to **false**, the sender of the target email message is added to the blocked sender list and the email message is not moved from the folder.
    
- If the **IsJunk** attribute is set to **false**, and the **MoveItem** attribute is set to **true**, the sender of the target email messageis removed from the blocked sender list and the email message is moved to the Inbox folder.
    
- If the **IsJunk** attribute is set to **false**, and the **MoveItem** attribute is set to **false**, the sender of the target email message is removed from the blocked sender list and the email message is not moved from the folder.
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The contents of the blocked sender list are not discoverable from EWS. If a sender is added to the blocked sender list, you need to keep a copy of an email message sent by the blocked sender to unblock the sender in the future.

The **MarkAsJunk** operation can use the SOAP headers that are listed in the following table. 
  
|**Header name**|**Element**|**Description**|

## MarkAsJunk operation request example: Remove a sender from the blocked sender list

The following example of a **MarkAsJunk** operation request shows how to remove the sender of an email message from the blocked sender list and move the email message to the Inbox folder. You need to keep an email message sent by the blocked sender to remove the sender from the blocked sender list. The sender's email address is associated with email messages that have been sent by the sender. Removing a sender from the blocked sender list will not succeed if the reference email message no longer exists in the user's mailbox. The item identifier used to associate an email message with its sender must be associated with an item that exists in the Exchange mailbox. We recommend that you create a hidden folder to store items sent by previously blocked senders so that the senders can be unblocked from the client application. In the event that an item has been removed from the Exchange mailbox, an administrator has to use the Exchange Management Console to access the blocked sender list to remove a sender from the list. For information about how to unblock a user by using the Exchange Management Console, see [How to configure the safe senders and blocked senders settings in Office 365](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2545137).
  
```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
               xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages" 
               xmlns:t="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types" 
               xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
    <soap:Header>
      <t:RequestServerVersion Version="Exchange2013" />
    </soap:Header>
    <soap:Body>
      <m:MarkAsJunk IsJunk="false" MoveItem="true">
        <m:ItemIds>
          <t:ItemId Id="AAMkAD=" ChangeKey="CQAAABYu" />
        </m:ItemIds>
      </m:MarkAsJunk>
    </soap:Body>
 </soap:Envelope>

```

A successful response for removing a sender from the blocked sender list is the same as the response for adding a sender to the blocked sender list.
  
The request SOAP body contains the following elements:
  
- [MarkAsJunk](markasjunk.md)
    
- [ItemIds](itemids.md)
    
- [ItemId](itemid.md)
