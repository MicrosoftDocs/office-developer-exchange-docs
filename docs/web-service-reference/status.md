# Status

The **Status** element represents the status of a task item. 
  
```xml
<Status/>
```

 **TaskStatusType**
## Attributes and elements

The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.
  
### Attributes

None.
  
### Child elements

None.
  
### Parent elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[Task](task.md) <br/> |Represents a task in the Exchange store.  <br/> |
   
## Text value

A text value is required. The following are the possible text values for this element:
  
- NotStarted
    
- InProgress
    
- Completed
    
- WaitingOnOthers
    
- Deferred
    
## Remarks

Setting [CompleteDate](completedate.md) has the same effect as setting [PercentComplete](percentcomplete.md) to 100 or **Status** to **Completed**. In a request that sets at least two of these properties, the last processed property will determine the value that is set for these elements. For example, if **PercentComplete** is 100, **CompleteDate** is 1/1/2007, and **Status** is NotStarted, and the properties are streamed in this order, the effect will be to set the **Status** of the task to NotStarted, the **CompleteDate** to **null**, and the **PercentComplete** to 0. 
  
The schema that describes this element is located in the EWS virtual directory of the computer that is running Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 that has the Client Access server role installed.
