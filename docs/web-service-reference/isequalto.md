|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[FieldURI](fielduri.md) <br/> |Identifies frequently referenced properties by URI.  <br/> |
|[IndexedFieldURI](indexedfielduri.md) <br/> |Identifies individual members of a dictionary.  <br/> |

|[FieldURIOrConstant](fielduriorconstant.md) <br/> |Represents either a property or a constant value to be used when comparing with another property.  <br/> |
   
### Parent elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[Restriction](restriction.md) <br/> |Represents the restriction or query that is used to filter items or folders in FindItem/FindFolder and search folder operations.  <br/> |
|[Not](not.md) <br/> |Represents a search expression that negates the Boolean value of the search expression that it contains.  <br/> |
|[And](and.md) <br/> |Represents a search expression that allows you to perform a Boolean And operation between two or more search expressions. The result of the And operation is **true** if all of the search expressions contained within the And are **true**.  <br/> |
|[Or](or.md) <br/> |Represents a search expression that performs a logical OR on the search expression that it contains. [Or](or.md) will return true if any of its children return true. **Or** must have two or more children.  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

To perform string comparisons, consider using the [Contains](contains.md) element, as it provides options for matching parameters, such as case and white space. Use the [Not](not.md) element in conjunction with the [Contains](contains.md) element to negate the result.
