## Attributes and elements

The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.
  
### Attributes

|Attribute|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|**MessageDisposition** <br/> |Describes how the item will be handled after it is created. The attribute is required for e-mail messages. This attribute is only applicable to e-mail messages.  <br/> |
|**SendMeetingInvitations** <br/> |Describes how meeting requests are handled after they are created. This attribute is required for calendar items.  <br/> |
   
#### MessageDisposition Attribute

|Value|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|SaveOnly  <br/> |The message item is saved in the folder that is specified by the [SavedItemFolderId](saveditemfolderid.md) element. Messages can be sent later by using the [SendItem operation](senditem-operation.md). An item identifier is returned in the response. Item identifiers are not returned for any item types except for message items. This includes response objects.  <br/> |
|SendOnly  <br/> |The item is sent but no copy is saved in the Sent Items folder. An item identifier is not returned in the response.<br/><br/>**NOTE**: **CreateItem** does not support delegate access when the SendOnly option is used because a destination folder cannot be specified with this option. The workaround is to create the item, get the item identifier, and then use the SendItem operation to send the item.           |
|SendAndSaveCopy  <br/> |The item is sent and a copy is saved in the folder that is identified by the [SavedItemFolderId](saveditemfolderid.md) element. An item identifier is not returned in the response.<br/><br/>**NOTE**: Meeting requests are not saved to the folder that is identified by the [SavedItemFolderId](saveditemfolderid.md) property. For calendaring, only the save location for calendar items can be specified by the **SavedItemFolderId** property. You cannot control where a meeting request item is saved. Only the associated calendar items are copied and saved into the folder that is identified by the **SavedItemFolderId** property.           |
   
#### SendMeetingInvitations Attribute

|Value|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|SendToNone  <br/> |If the item is a meeting request, it is saved as a calendar item but not sent.  <br/> |
|SendOnlyToAll  <br/> |The meeting request is sent to all attendees but is not saved in the Sent Items folder.  <br/> |
|SendToAllAndSaveCopy  <br/> |The meeting request is sent to all attendees and a copy is saved in the folder that is identified by the [SavedItemFolderId](saveditemfolderid.md) element.  <br/> |
   
### Child elements

|Element|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|[SavedItemFolderId](saveditemfolderid.md) <br/> |Identifies the target folder where a new item can be created.

The message will not be put in the folder that is identified by the [SavedItemFolderId](saveditemfolderid.md) element.  <br/> |
