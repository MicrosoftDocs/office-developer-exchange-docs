### Version differences

For applications that target Exchange Online, Exchange Online as part of Office 365, or an on-premises version of Exchange starting with Exchange 2013, folder permissions are not returned when the [BaseShape](baseshape.md) element has a value of **AllProperties** in the [GetFolder](getfolder-operation.md) operation request. To retrieve folder permissions, add the [PermissionSet (PermissionSetType)](permissionset-permissionsettype.md) element to the [AdditionalProperties](additionalproperties.md) element in the **GetFolder** request.
