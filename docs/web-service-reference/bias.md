# Bias

The **Bias** element represents the offset from the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) offset identified by the [Bias (UTC)](bias-utc.md) element for standard time and daylight saving time. This value is in minutes. 
  
```xml
<Bias>...</Bias>
```

**int**

## Attributes and elements

The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.
  
### Attributes

None.
  
### Child elements

None.
  
### Parent elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[StandardTime](standardtime.md) <br/> | Represents an offset from the time relative to UTC represented by the [Bias (UTC)](bias-utc.md) element. This element also contains information about the transition to standard time from daylight saving time in regions where daylight saving time is observed.<br/><br/>The following are the XPath expressions to the [StandardTime](standardtime.md) element:<br/><br/>   `/GetUserAvailabilityResponse/FreeBusyResponseArray/FreeBusyResponse/FreeBusyView/WorkingHours/TimeZone/StandardTime` <br/><br/> `/GetUserAvailabilityRequest/TimeZone/StandardTime` <br/> |
|[DaylightTime](daylighttime.md) <br/> | Represents an offset from the time relative to UTC represented by the [Bias (UTC)](bias-utc.md) element in regions where daylight saving time is observed. This element also contains information about when the transition to daylight saving time from standard time occurs.  <br/><br/>The following are the XPath expressions to the [DaylightTime](daylighttime.md) element:<br/><br/> `/GetUserAvailabilityResponse/FreeBusyResponseArray/FreeBusyResponse/FreeBusyView/WorkingHours/TimeZone/DaylightTime` <br/><br/> `/GetUserAvailabilityRequest/TimeZone/DaylightTime` <br/> |
   
## Text value

A text value is required. The text value represents an integer.
  
## Remarks

The offset used to determine the local time can only be provided by one of the **Bias** elements. The sum of the values of the Bias element provided by the [DaylightTime](daylighttime.md) element or the [StandardTime](standardtime.md) element plus the [Bias (UTC)](bias-utc.md) element identifies the local time. 
  
## Example

The following example shows part of an XML request that identifies a user who observes daylight saving time by adjusting the offset from UTC by -60 minutes. This effectively makes the bias 420 minutes from UTC.
  
```xml
<TimeZone xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types">
  <Bias>480</Bias>
  <StandardTime>
    <Bias>0</Bias>
    <Time>02:00:00</Time>
    <DayOrder>5</DayOrder>
    <Month>10</Month>
    <DayOfWeek>Sunday</DayOfWeek>
  </StandardTime>
  <DaylightTime>
    <Bias>-60</Bias>
    <Time>02:00:00</Time>
    <DayOrder>1</DayOrder>
    <Month>4</Month>
    <DayOfWeek>Sunday</DayOfWeek>
  </DaylightTime>
</TimeZone>
```
