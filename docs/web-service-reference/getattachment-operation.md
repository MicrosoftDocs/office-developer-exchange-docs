# GetAttachment operation

The GetAttachment operation is used to retrieve existing attachments on items in the Exchange store.
  
## GetAttachment request example

### Description

The following example of GetAttachment request shows how to get an attachment.
  
### Code

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
xmlns:t="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types">
  <soap:Body>
    <GetAttachment xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages"
    xmlns:t="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types">
      <AttachmentShape/>
      <AttachmentIds>
        <t:AttachmentId Id="AAAtAEFkbWluaX..."/>
      </AttachmentIds>
    </GetAttachment>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

### Comments

The [AttachmentShape](attachmentshape.md) element allows you to specify which attachment information should be returned. An empty [AttachmentShape](attachmentshape.md) element is valid and will render your attachments without MIME content for item attachments, with a text body type, and without any additional properties. 
  
The [AttachmentIds](attachmentids.md) collection allows you to specify one or more attachment identifiers to return. Note that these are of type RequestAttachmentIdType, so any AttachmentIds that you receive from **CreateAttachment** must have the **RootItemId** and **RootItemChangeKey** attributes removed before passing them to **GetAttachment**.
  
> [!NOTE]
> The attachment identifier and change key have been shortened to preserve readability. 
  
### Request elements

The following elements are used in the request:
  
- [GetAttachment](getattachment.md)
    
- [AttachmentShape](attachmentshape.md)
    
- [AttachmentIds](attachmentids.md)
    
- [AttachmentId (GetAttachment and DeleteAttachment)](attachmentid-getattachment-and-deleteattachment.md)
    
## GetAttachment response example

### Description

### Code

               xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

              <t:Name>SomeFile</t:Name>
              <t:Content>AQIDBAU=</t:Content>
            </t:FileAttachment>
          </m:Attachments>
        </m:GetAttachmentResponseMessage>
      </m:ResponseMessages>
    </GetAttachmentResponse>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

### Comments

The response messages for GetAttachment will always contain the full attachment; that is, all properties will always be included. For file attachments, those properties are [Name (AttachmentType)](name-attachmenttype.md), [ContentType](contenttype.md), [ContentId](contentid.md), [ContentLocation](contentlocation.md), and [Content](content.md). For item attachments, those properties are [Name (AttachmentType)](name-attachmenttype.md), [ContentType](contenttype.md), [ContentId](contentid.md), [ContentLocation](contentlocation.md) and all of the item's properties, as if the **AllProperties** shape had been used in a GetItem call. The [AttachmentShape](attachmentshape.md) element, if present, will allow a consumer application to request additional extended properties for item attachments.

- [ServerVersionInfo](serverversioninfo.md)
    
- [GetAttachmentResponse](getattachmentresponse.md)
