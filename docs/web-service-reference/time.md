### Parent elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[StandardTime](standardtime.md) <br/> | Represents an offset from the time relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) represented by the [Bias (UTC)](bias-utc.md) element. This element also contains information about the transition to standard time from daylight saving time in regions where daylight saving time is observed.  <br/><br/>  The following are the XPath expressions to the [StandardTime](standardtime.md) element: <br/> <br/>  `/GetUserAvailabilityResponse/FreeBusyResponseArray/FreeBusyResponse/FreeBusyView/WorkingHours/TimeZone/StandardTime`<br/> <br/>  `/GetUserAvailabilityRequest/TimeZone/StandardTime` <br/> |
|[DaylightTime](daylighttime.md) <br/> | Represents an offset from the time relative to UTC represented by the [Bias (UTC)](bias-utc.md) element in regions where daylight saving time is observed. This element also contains information about when the transition to daylight saving time from standard time occurs.  <br/><br/>  The following are the XPath expressions to the [DaylightTime](daylighttime.md) element:  <br/><br/>  `/GetUserAvailabilityResponse/FreeBusyResponseArray/FreeBusyResponse/FreeBusyView/WorkingHours/TimeZone/DaylightTime` <br/><br/>  `/GetUserAvailabilityRequest/TimeZone/DaylightTime` <br/> |
   
## Text value

The text value represents hours, minutes, and seconds in the following format: hh:mm:ss.
  
## Remarks

When the **Time** element occurs in the [DaylightTime](daylighttime.md) element, it represents the time of day that the transition from daylight saving time to standard time occurs. When the [Time](time.md) element occurs in the [StandardTime](standardtime.md) element, it represents the time of day that the transition from standard time to daylight saving time occurs. 
  
This element has a minimum occurrence of zero and a maximum occurrence of one.
  
## Example

The following part of a request represents a transition time of 2 A.M. from standard time to daylight saving time.
  
```xml
<StandardTime>
   <Bias>0</Bias>
   <Time>02:00:00</Time>
   <DayOrder>5</DayOrder>
   <Month>10</Month>
   <DayOfWeek>Sunday</DayOfWeek>
</StandardTime
```
