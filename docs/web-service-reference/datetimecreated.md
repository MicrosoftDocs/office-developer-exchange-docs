## Text value

The text value represents the date and time when an item in the mailbox was created.
  
## Remarks

Using calendar response objects updates the [DateTimeCreated](datetimecreated.md) property on the associated calendar item. The expected behavior is for the **DateTimeCreated** property to remain unchanged. For example, user A sends a meeting request to user B. User B accepts the meeting request with the identifier of the meeting request. The **DateTimeCreated** property of the associated calendar item is changed.
