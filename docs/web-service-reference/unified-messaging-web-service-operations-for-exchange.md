# Unified Messaging web service operations for Exchange

Find reference information for the Unified Messaging web service operations in Exchange.
  
The Unified Messaging web service provides many operations that enable client applications to read and change Unified Messaging properties, play voice mail messages, record greetings, and dictate mailbox items over telephony devices. The articles in this section provide information about the overall structure of the request and response messages for the operations. These articles provide examples that show common message structures. You can use these examples to learn about what you can do with a Unified Messaging web service request.
  
> [!NOTE]
> For versions of Exchange starting with Exchange 2010, we recommend that you use the Unified Messaging operations that are available in [Exchange Web Services (EWS)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/60285497-0c4e-4e51-84e1-34dd6d89a5d8%28Office.15%29.aspx) instead of the Unified Messaging web service, for the following reasons: 
> - The EWS-based Unified Messaging features have first-class support in the EWS Managed API. 
> - In versions of Exchange starting with Exchange 2010, new Unified Messaging features are added to EWS but not to the Unified Messaging web service.
