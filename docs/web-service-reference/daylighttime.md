# DaylightTime

The **DaylightTime** element represents an offset from the time relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) that is represented by the [Bias (UTC)](bias-utc.md) element in regions where daylight saving time is observed. This element also contains information about when the transition to daylight saving time from standard time occurs. 
  
- [TimeZone (Availability)](timezone-availability.md) 
- [DaylightTime](daylighttime.md)
  
```xml
<DaylightTime>
   <Bias>int</Bias>
   <Time>string</Time>
   <DayOrder>short</DayOrder>
