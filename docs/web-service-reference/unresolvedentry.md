## Attributes and elements

### Parent elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[ResolveNames](resolvenames.md) <br/> |Defines a request to resolve ambiguous names.  <br/> |
   
## Text value

The text value represents the name of a public contact or distribution list. The minimum length of the string is one character.
  
## Remarks

The text value of this element is used to resolve names against the following fields:
  
- First name
    
- Last name
    
- Display name
    
- Full name
    
- Office
    
- Alias
    
- SMTP address
    
Email addresses with prefixed routing types, such as smtp or sip, are saved in a multivalue array. The [ResolveNames operation](resolvenames-operation.md) performs a partial match against each value of that array when you add the routing type at the beginning of the unresolved name, such as "sip:User1@Contoso.com". If you don't specify a routing type, the **ResolveNames** operation will default to the routing type of smtp, match it to a primary SMTP address property, and not search the multivalue array. 
  
The schema that describes this element is located in the IIS virtual directory that hosts Exchange Web Services.
