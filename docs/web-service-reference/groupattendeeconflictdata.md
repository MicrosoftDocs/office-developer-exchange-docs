## Attributes and elements

The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.
  
### Attributes

None.
  
### Child elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[NumberOfMembers](numberofmembers.md) <br/> |Represents the number of users, resources, and rooms in a distribution list.  <br/> |
|[NumberOfMembersAvailable](numberofmembersavailable.md) <br/> |Represents the number of distribution list members who are available for a suggested meeting time. This element represents members for whom the status is **Free**.  <br/> |
|[NumberOfMembersWithConflict](numberofmemberswithconflict.md) <br/> |Represents the number of distribution list members who have a conflict with a suggested meeting time. This element represents members who have a **Busy**, **OOF**, or **Tentative** status.  <br/> |
|[NumberOfMembersWithNoData](numberofmemberswithnodata.md) <br/> |Represents the number of group members who do not have published free/busy data to compare to a suggested meeting time. This element represents members of a distribution list that is too large or members who have **No Data** status.  <br/> |
   
### Parent elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[AttendeeConflictDataArray](attendeeconflictdataarray.md) <br/> |Contains an array of conflict data for queried attendees identified in the [GetUserAvailability operation](getuseravailability-operation.md).  <br/> The following is the XPath expression to this element:  <br/>  `/GetUserAvailabilityResponse/SuggestionsResponse/SuggestionDayResultArray/SuggestionDayResult[i]/SuggestionArray/Suggestion[i]/AttendeeConflictDataArray` <br/> |
   
## Remarks

The **GroupAttendeeConflictData** element is present in the response when an attendee in the [GetUserAvailabilityRequest](getuseravailabilityrequest.md) is resolved to a distribution list. The **GroupAttendeeConflictData** element identifies three states for members of a distribution list: available, conflicted, or no data. Distribution list expansion will support up to 100 members. Therefore, the [NumberOfMembers](numberofmembers.md) element can contain a maximum of 100 members. Distribution list expansion is recursive. If a distribution list contains a child distribution list that expands the total parent membership to over 100 members, the child distribution list will not be expanded and will count as a single entry of the [NumberOfMembersWithNoData](numberofmemberswithnodata.md) element count. If a child distribution list can be expanded and the total parent membership does not expand to over 100 members, its membership is expanded and the member counts are added to the child elements of the **GroupAttendeeConflictData** element. 
  
The schema that describes this element is located in the EWS virtual directory of the computer that is running MicrosoftExchange Server 2007 that has the Client Access server role installed.
