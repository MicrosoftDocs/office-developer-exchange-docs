## Text value

The text value represents the end of a duration.
  
## Remarks

The UpdateItem operation can set the [Start](start.md) and **End** time of an Exchange store item. In an UpdateItem request, you can set the [Start](start.md) time without also setting the **End** time. This can cause an error if the [Start](start.md) time is later than the **End** time. Be aware that client applications must perform adjustments to the **End** time when that [Start](start.md) time is changed in order to preserve the duration. 
  
 **Note** The time zone offset information is lost if the [Start](start.md) and **End** dates of the recurring master item do not have a date that is equal to the first occurrence of a weekly recurrence pattern. 
  
The schema that describes this element is located in the EWS virtual directory of the computer that is running Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 that has the Client Access server role installed.
