### Child elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[FolderId](folderid.md) <br/> |Contains the required identifier and the optional change key of a folder in which a new folder is created or the folder that is searched for the [FindConversation operation](findconversation-operation.md). Using this element excludes the use of the [DistinguishedFolderId](distinguishedfolderid.md) element.  <br/> |
|[DistinguishedFolderId](distinguishedfolderid.md) <br/> |Identifies default Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 folders. Using this element excludes the use of the [FolderId](folderid.md) element.  <br/> |
   
### Parent elements

|**Element**|**Description**|

|[CreateFolder](createfolder.md) <br/> |Defines a request to create a folder in the Exchange database.  <br/> The following is the XPath expression to this element:  `/CreateFolder` <br/> |
|[FindConversation](findconversation.md) <br/> |Defines a request to find conversations in a mailbox.  <br/> |
   
## Text value

None.
  
## Remarks

The two child elements are used to define the folder that will contain the new folder. You must select either the [FolderId](folderid.md) or the [DistinguishedFolderId](distinguishedfolderid.md) element to identify the parent folder of the new folder. You cannot use both elements at the same time. This element is required to create folders. 
  
The [ParentFolderId](parentfolderid.md) element describes the location of existing items and folders. 
  
The schema that describes this element is located in the IIS virtual directory that hosts Exchange Web Services.
