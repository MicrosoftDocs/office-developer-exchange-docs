## Text value

A text value is required. The value for the **DayOrder** element can be 1 through 5. The maximum value for this element can be either 4 or 5, depending on the month and year. A value of 0 is used in the Timezone–StandardTime–DayOrder and Timezone–DaylightTime–DayOrder elements if the timezone does not observe DST.
