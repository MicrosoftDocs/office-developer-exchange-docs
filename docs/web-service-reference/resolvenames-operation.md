# ResolveNames operation

The **ResolveNames** operation resolves ambiguous email addresses and display names. 
  
## Using the ResolveNames operation

This operation can be used to verify aliases and resolve display names to the appropriate mailbox user. If ambiguous names exist, the **ResolveNames** operation response provides information about each mailbox user so that the client application can resolve the names. 
  
## Remarks

The ResolveNames response returns a maximum of 100 candidates. The 100 candidates that are returned are the first 100 that are encountered in the lookup operation.
  
Email addresses with prefixed routing types, such as smtp or sip, are saved in a multivalue array. The **ResolveNames** operation performs a partial match against each value of that array when you add the routing type at the beginning of the unresolved name, such as "sip:User1@Contoso.com". If you don't specify a routing type, **ResolveNames** will default to the routing type of smtp, match it to a primary smtp address property, and not search the multivalue array. 
  
Only one ambiguous name can be specified in a single request. Active Directory is searched first, and then the user's contact folder is searched. Resolved entries from a user's contact folder have a non-null **ItemId** property, which can then be used in a GetItem request. If it is the ID of a private distribution list, then it can be used in an [ExpandDL operation](expanddl-operation.md). If the **ReturnFullContactData** attribute is set to **true**, then Active Directory entries found with the **ResolveNames** operation will return additional properties that describe a [Contact](contact.md). The **ReturnFullContactData** attribute does not affect the data that is returned for contacts and private distribution lists from the user's contact folder. 
  
## ResolveNames request example

### Description

The following example of a **ResolveNames** request shows how to resolve the entry of User.
  
### Code

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
               xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
               xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
               xmlns:t="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types">
  <soap:Body>
    <ResolveNames xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages"
                  xmlns:t="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types"
                  ReturnFullContactData="true">
      <UnresolvedEntry>User2</UnresolvedEntry>
    </ResolveNames>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

### Comments

The response to this request will return all entries that start with "Jo" or "Mi." The returned items are public mailboxes, public and private distribution lists, and contacts.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Only contacts in the default personal Contacts folder are searched. 
  
The following are the possible results for a **ResolveNames** request: 
  
- Responses that do not contain a resolved entity will return a **ResponseClass** attribute value equal to **Error**. The **MessageText** element will contain " **No results are found**."
    
- Responses that contain a single resolved entity will return a **ResponseClass** attribute value equal to **Success**.
    
- Responses that contain multiple possible entities will return a **ResponseClass** attribute value equal to **Warning**. In this case, the entity could not be resolved to a unique identity. The **MessageText** element will contain "Multiple results are found." 
    
### Request elements

The following elements are used in the request:
  
- [ResolveNames](resolvenames.md)
    
- [UnresolvedEntry](unresolvedentry.md)
