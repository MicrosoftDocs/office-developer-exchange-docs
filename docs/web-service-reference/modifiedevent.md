## Remarks

Two modified events are generated for each modification of an item in a folder. One event is relevant to the item that changed. The other event is relevant to the parent folder of the item. This is the same folder that the subscription was created against. The event that is associated with the folder is used to communicate a potential change to the [UnreadCount](unreadcount.md) property on the folder.
