# TimeZone (Availability)

The **TimeZone** element contains elements that identify time zone information. This element also contains information about the transition between standard time and daylight saving time. 
  
```xml
<TimeZone>
   <Bias/>
   <StandardTime/>
   <DaylightTime/>
</TimeZone>
```

 **SerializableTimeZone**
## Attributes and elements

The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.
  
### Attributes

None.
  
### Child elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[Bias (UTC)](bias-utc.md) <br/> |Represents the general offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This value is in minutes.  <br/> |
|[StandardTime](standardtime.md) <br/> |Represents an offset from the time relative to UTC represented by the [Bias (UTC)](bias-utc.md) element. This element also contains information about the transition to standard time from daylight saving time in regions where daylight saving time is observed.  <br/> |
|[DaylightTime](daylighttime.md) <br/> |Represents an offset from the time relative to UTC represented by the [Bias (UTC)](bias-utc.md) element in regions where daylight saving time is observed. This element also contains information about when the transition to daylight saving time from standard time occurs.  <br/> |
   
### Parent elements

|**Element**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[GetUserAvailabilityRequest](getuseravailabilityrequest.md) <br/> |Contains the arguments used to obtain user availability information. This is a root element.  <br/> The **TimeZone** element in the GetUserAvailabilityRequest message represents the time zone in which the DateTime values in the request are specified. The DateTime values returned by the Availability service are also in this time zone.  <br/> The following is the XPath to this element:  <br/>  `/GetUserAvailabilityRequest` <br/> |
|[WorkingHours](workinghours-ex15websvcsotherref.md) <br/> |Represents the time zone settings and working hours for the requested mailbox user.  <br/> The **TimeZone** element in the GetUserAvailabilityResponse message represents the time zone settings of the requested mailbox user.  <br/> The following is the XPath to this element:  <br/>  `/GetUserAvailabilityResponse/FreeBusyResponseArray/FreeBusyResponse/FreeBusyView/WorkingHours` <br/> |
   
## Remarks

This element is required in the [GetUserAvailabilityRequest](getuseravailabilityrequest.md) element. This element occurs at most once or at least zero times when the parent element is the [WorkingHours](workinghours-ex15websvcsotherref.md) element. 
  
## Example

The following example shows part of an XML request that identifies an offset from UTC of 8 hours in the client application.
  
```XML
<TimeZone xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types">
  <Bias>480</Bias>
  <StandardTime>
    <Bias>0</Bias>
    <Time>02:00:00</Time>
    <DayOrder>1</DayOrder>
    <Month>11</Month>
    <DayOfWeek>Sunday</DayOfWeek>
  </StandardTime>
  <DaylightTime>
    <Bias>-60</Bias>
    <Time>02:00:00</Time>
    <DayOrder>2</DayOrder>
    <Month>3</Month>
    <DayOfWeek>Sunday</DayOfWeek>
  </DaylightTime>
</TimeZone>
```
