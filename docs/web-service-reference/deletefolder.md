</DeleteFolder>
```

## Attributes and elements

The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.

None.
  
## Remarks

The **MoveToDeletedItems** and **HardDelete** options are transactional, which means that by the time a Web service call completes, the database has moved the item to the Deleted Items folder or permanently removed the item from the Exchange database. This behavior is the same for MicrosoftExchange Server 2007 and Exchange Server 2010. 
  
The schema that describes this element is located in the IIS virtual directory that hosts Exchange Web Services.
