# eDiscovery in EWS in Exchange

Learn about eDiscovery in EWS in Exchange.
  
eDiscovery is a federated query web service that enables external applications to perform queries of Exchange data.
  
Discovery consists of several phases, including identifying and preserving key data, culling down and reviewing the data, and producing data in court. eDiscovery queries facilitate the discovery process by providing a single discovery workflow across Exchange and SharePoint.
  
## eDiscovery operations

The eDiscovery functionality that is exposed by EWS is available via operations introduced in Exchange Online, Exchange Online as part of Office 365, and versions of Exchange starting with Exchange 2013.
