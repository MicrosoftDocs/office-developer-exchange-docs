# Process email messages in batches by using EWS in Exchange

Learn how to create, get, update, and delete batches of email messages in a single call by using the EWS Managed API or EWS in Exchange.

You can use the EWS Managed API or EWS to work with batches of email messages to reduce the number of calls a client makes to an Exchange server. When you use the EWS Managed API to create, get, update, delete, and send messages in batches, you use [ExchangeService](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object methods, whereas when you work with single email messages, you use [EmailMessage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.emailmessage%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object methods. If you are using EWS, you use the same operations to work with both single and batches of email messages.

In this article, you'll learn how to complete basic tasks for batches of email messages by using the EWS Managed API or EWS.

## Create email messages in batches by using the EWS Managed API
<a name="bk_createewsma"> </a>

You can create messages in batches by using the EWS Managed API **CreateItems** method, as shown in the following example. This example creates three [EmailMessage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.emailmessage%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) objects locally, adds each message to a collection, then calls the **CreateItems** method on the collection of messages.

This example assumes that **service** is a valid [ExchangeService](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object and that the user has been authenticated to an Exchange server.

```cs
public static Collection<ItemId> CreateDraftEmailInBatch(ExchangeService service)
{
    // These are unsaved local instances of an EmailMessage object.
    // Despite the required parameter of an ExchangeService object (service), no call
    // to an Exchange server is made when the objects are instantiated.
    // A call to the Exchange server is made when the service.CreateItems() method is called.
    EmailMessage message1 = new EmailMessage(service);
    EmailMessage message2 = new EmailMessage(service);
    EmailMessage message3 = new EmailMessage(service);
    // Set the properties on the first message.
    message1.Subject = "Project priorities";
    message1.Body = "(1) Buy pizza, (2) Eat pizza";
    message1.ToRecipients.Add("sadie@contoso.com");
    // Set the properties on the second message.
    message2.Subject = "Company Soccer Team";
    message2.Body = "Are you interested in joining?";
    message2.ToRecipients.Add("magdalena@contoso.com");
    // Set the properties on the third message.
    message3.Subject = "Code Blast";
    message3.Body = "Are you interested in getting together to finish the methods for the ContosoLive project?";
    message3.ToRecipients.Add("mack@contoso.com");
    // Add the EmailMessage objects to a collection.
    Collection<EmailMessage> messageItems = new Collection<EmailMessage>() { message1, message2, message3 };
    // Create the batch of email messages on the server.
    // This method call results in an CreateItem call to EWS.
    ServiceResponseCollection<ServiceResponse> response = service.CreateItems(messageItems, WellKnownFolderName.Drafts, MessageDisposition.SaveOnly, null);
    // Instantiate a collection of item IDs to populate from the values that are returned by the Exchange server.
    Collection<ItemId> itemIds = new Collection<ItemId>();
    // Collect the item IDs from the created email messages.
    foreach (EmailMessage message in messageItems)
    {
        try
        {
            itemIds.Add(message.Id);
            Console.WriteLine("Email message '{0}' created successfully.", message.Subject);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Print out the exception and the last eight characters of the item ID.
            Console.WriteLine("Exception while creating message {0}: {1}", message.Id.ToString().Substring(144), ex.Message);
        }
    }
    // Check for success of the CreateItems method call.
    if (response.OverallResult == ServiceResult.Success)
    {
            Console.WriteLine("All locally created messages were successfully saved to the Drafts folder.");
            Console.WriteLine("\r\n");
    }

    // If the method did not return success, print the result message for each email.
    else
    {
        int counter = 1;
        foreach (ServiceResponse resp in response)
        {
            // Print out the result and the last eight characters of the item ID.
            Console.WriteLine("Result (message {0}), id {1}: {2}", counter, itemIds[counter - 1].ToString().Substring(144), resp.Result);
            Console.WriteLine("Error Code: {0}", resp.ErrorCode);
            Console.WriteLine("ErrorMessage: {0}\r\n", resp.ErrorMessage);
            Console.WriteLine("\r\n");
            counter++;
        }
    }
    return itemIds;
}
```

Note that the example only saves the messages in the Drafts folder; it does not send the messages. For more about how to send the messages, see [Send email messages in batches by using the EWS Managed API](#bk_sendewsma).

## Create email messages in batches by using EWS
<a name="bk_createews"> </a>

You can create email messages in batches by using the [CreateItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/fe6bb7fc-8918-4e6e-b0a1-b7e0ef44c3d1%28Office.15%29.aspx) EWS operation, as shown in the following code example. This is also the XML request that the EWS Managed API sends when you use the EWS Managed API to [create email messages in batches](#bk_createewsma).

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

          </t:ToRecipients>
        </t:Message>
      </m:Items>
    </m:CreateItem>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

The server responds to the **CreateItem** request with a [CreateItemResponse](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/742a46a0-2475-45a0-b44f-90639a3f5a43%28Office.15%29.aspx) message that includes a [ResponseCode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4b84d670-74c9-4d6d-84e7-f0a9f76f0d93%28Office.15%29.aspx) value of **NoError** for each of the new messages, which indicates that each email was created and saved successfully.

Note that the example only saves the messages in the Drafts folder; it does not send the messages. For more about how to send the messages, see [Send email messages in batches by using EWS](#bk_sendews).

## Send email messages in batches by using the EWS Managed API
<a name="bk_sendewsma"> </a>

You use the same code to send email messages in batches that you use to create email messages in batches, except that a few of the [CreateItems](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice.createitems%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method parameters change. So, to send email messages by using the EWS Managed API, use the code you use to [create email messages in batches](#bk_createewsma), and replace the call to the **CreateItems** method with the call in the following example. In this example, the messages are created in the Sent Items folder, and the message disposition is changed to [MessageDisposition.SendAndSaveCopy](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.messagedisposition%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx), so that the message is sent, and not just saved locally.

```cs
// Create and send the batch of email messages on the server.
// This method call results in an CreateItem call to EWS.
ServiceResponseCollection<ServiceResponse> response = service.CreateItems(messageItems, WellKnownFolderName.SentItems, MessageDisposition.SendAndSaveCopy, null);
```

## Send email messages in batches by using EWS
<a name="bk_sendews"> </a>

You use the same code to send email messages in batches that you use to create email messages in batches, except that a few of the attribute values change for the **CreateItem** operation. So, to send email messages by using EWS, use the code you use to [create email message in batches](#bk_createews), and change the **MessageDisposition** value to "SendAndSaveCopy", and change the [DistinguishedFolderId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/50018162-2941-4227-8a5b-d6b4686bb32f%28Office.15%29.aspx) to "sentitems", as shown in the following code example.

```XML
<m:CreateItem MessageDisposition="SendAndSaveCopy">
  <m:SavedItemFolderId>
    <t:DistinguishedFolderId Id="sentitems" />
  </m:SavedItemFolderId>
```

The server responds to the **CreateItem** request with a [CreateItemResponse](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/742a46a0-2475-45a0-b44f-90639a3f5a43%28Office.15%29.aspx) message that includes a [ResponseCode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4b84d670-74c9-4d6d-84e7-f0a9f76f0d93%28Office.15%29.aspx) value of **NoError** for each of the new messages, which indicates that each email was created and sent successfully.

## Get email messages in batches by using the EWS Managed API
<a name="bk_getewsma"> </a>

You can get email messages in batches by using the EWS Managed API [BindToItems](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice.bindtoitems%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method, as shown in the following example.

This example assumes that **service** is a valid [ExchangeService](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object and that the user has been authenticated to an Exchange server.

```cs
public static Collection<EmailMessage> BatchGetEmailItems(ExchangeService service, Collection<ItemId> itemIds)
{
    // Create a property set that limits the properties returned by the Bind method to only those that are required.
    PropertySet propSet = new PropertySet(BasePropertySet.IdOnly, EmailMessageSchema.Subject, EmailMessageSchema.ToRecipients);
    // Get the items from the server.
    // This method call results in a GetItem call to EWS.
    ServiceResponseCollection<GetItemResponse> response = service.BindToItems(itemIds, propSet);

    // Instantiate a collection of EmailMessage objects to populate from the values that are returned by the Exchange server.
    Collection<EmailMessage> messageItems = new Collection<EmailMessage>();
    foreach (GetItemResponse getItemResponse in response)
    {
        try
        {
            Item item = getItemResponse.Item;
            EmailMessage message = (EmailMessage)item;
            messageItems.Add(message);
            // Print out confirmation and the last eight characters of the item ID.
            Console.WriteLine("Found item {0}.", message.Id.ToString().Substring(144));
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
           Console.WriteLine("Exception while getting a message: {0}", ex.Message);
        }
    }
    // Check for success of the BindToItems method call.
    if (response.OverallResult == ServiceResult.Success)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("All email messages retrieved successfully.");
        Console.WriteLine("\r\n");
    }
        return messageItems;
}
```

## Get email messages in batches by using EWS
<a name="bk_getews"> </a>

You can get email messages in batches by using the [GetItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e8492e3b-1c8d-4b14-8070-9530f8306edd%28Office.15%29.aspx) EWS operation and the code in the following example. This is also the XML request that the EWS Managed API sends when you use the EWS Managed API to [get email messages in batches](#bk_getewsma).

The **ItemId** and **ChangeKey** attributes have been shortened for readability.

```XML

```

The server responds to the **GetItem** request with a [GetItemResponse](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8b66de1b-26a6-476c-9585-a96059125716%28Office.15%29.aspx) message that includes the [first class properties](email-properties-and-elements-in-ews-in-exchange.md) for each of the requested messages.

```cs
public static Collection<EmailMessage> BatchUpdateEmailItems(ExchangeService service, Collection<EmailMessage> messageItems)
{
    // Update the subject of each message locally.
    foreach (EmailMessage message in messageItems)
    {
        // Update the Subject of the email.
        message.Subject = "Updated subject at " + DateTime.Now;
        // Print out confirmation with the last eight characters of the item ID and the email subject.
        Console.WriteLine("Updated local email message {0} with the subject '{1}'.", message.Id.ToString().Substring(144), message.Subject);
    }
    // Send the item updates to the server.
    // This method call results in an UpdateItem call to EWS.
    ServiceResponseCollection<UpdateItemResponse> response = service.UpdateItems(messageItems, WellKnownFolderName.Drafts, ConflictResolutionMode.AutoResolve, MessageDisposition.SaveOnly, null);
    // Check for success of the UpdateItems method call.
    if (response.OverallResult == ServiceResult.Success)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("All email messages updated successfully.\r\n");
    }
    // If the method did not return success, print the result message for each email.
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("All emails were not successfully saved on the server.\r\n");
        int counter = 1;
        foreach (ServiceResponse resp in response)

The server responds to the **UpdateItem** request with an [UpdateItemResponse](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/023b79b4-c675-4669-9112-d85499ec4fc4%28Office.15%29.aspx) message that includes a [ResponseCode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4b84d670-74c9-4d6d-84e7-f0a9f76f0d93%28Office.15%29.aspx) value of **NoError**, which indicates that each of the updates was saved successfully on the server. Any conflicts are reported in the [ConflictResult](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/08cdd547-4de7-4c7a-b60f-e618dc217d20%28Office.15%29.aspx) element.

## Delete email messages in batches by using the EWS Managed API
<a name="bk_deleteewsma"> </a>

You can delete messages in batches by using the EWS Managed API [DeleteItems](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd635460%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method, as shown in the following example.

This example assumes that **service** is a valid [ExchangeService](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object and that the user has been authenticated to an Exchange server.

```cs
public static void BatchDeleteEmailItems(ExchangeService service, Collection<ItemId> itemIds)
{
    // Delete the batch of email message objects.
    // This method call results in an DeleteItem call to EWS.
    ServiceResponseCollection<ServiceResponse> response = service.DeleteItems(itemIds, DeleteMode.SoftDelete, null, AffectedTaskOccurrence.AllOccurrences);

    // Check for success of the DeleteItems method call.
    // DeleteItems returns success even if it does not find all the item IDs.
    if (response.OverallResult == ServiceResult.Success)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Email messages deleted successfully.\r\n");
    }
    // If the method did not return success, print a message.
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Not all email messages deleted successfully.\r\n");
    }
}
```

## Delete email messages in batches by using EWS
<a name="bk_deleteews"> </a>

You can delete email messages in batches by using the [DeleteItem](../web-service-reference/deleteitem-operation.md) EWS operation, as shown in the following code example. This is also the XML request that the EWS Managed API sends when you use the EWS Managed API to [delete email messages in batches](#bk_deleteewsma).

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
               xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages"
               xmlns:t="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types"
               xmlns:soap="https://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Header>
    <t:RequestServerVersion Version="Exchange2007_SP1" />
  </soap:Header>
  <soap:Body>
    <m:DeleteItem DeleteType="SoftDelete"
                  AffectedTaskOccurrences="AllOccurrences">
      <m:ItemIds>
        <t:ItemId Id="m4OkAAA="
                  ChangeKey="CQAAABYAAAApjGm7TnMWQ5TzjbhziLL0AAF/yKDE" />
        <t:ItemId Id="m4OlAAA="
                  ChangeKey="CQAAABYAAAApjGm7TnMWQ5TzjbhziLL0AAF/yKDF" />
        <t:ItemId Id="m4OmAAA="
                  ChangeKey="CQAAABYAAAApjGm7TnMWQ5TzjbhziLL0AAF/yKDG" />
      </m:ItemIds>
    </m:DeleteItem>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

The server responds to the **DeleteItem** request with a [DeleteItemResponse](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/86463d66-fe47-4a19-a81b-e24841e816ab%28Office.15%29.aspx) message that includes a [ResponseCode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4b84d670-74c9-4d6d-84e7-f0a9f76f0d93%28Office.15%29.aspx) value of **NoError** for each item that was removed. Note that the operation also returns success if the item ID could not be found.

## Verifying that a batch process completed successfully
<a name="bk_successful"> </a>

When one or more email messages in a batched request can't be processed as requested, an error is returned for each email message that failed, and the rest of the emails in the batch are processed as expected. Failures in batch processing can occur if the item was deleted, and therefore can't be sent, retrieved, or updated, or if the item moved to a different folder, and therefore has a new item ID, and cannot be modified with the item ID sent. The information in this section shows how to get error details about failures in batch processing of email message.

To verify the success of a batch process by using the EWS Managed API, you can check that the [OverallResult](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd634515%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) property of the [ServiceResponseCollection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd633715%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) is equal to [ServiceResult.Success](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceresult%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx). If so, all the emails were processed successfully. If the **OverallResult** is not equal to **ServiceResult.Success**, one or more of the emails were not processed successfully. Each of the objects returned in the **ServiceResponseCollection** contains the following properties:

- [ErrorCode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceresponse.errorcode%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx)

- [ErrorDetails](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceresponse.errordetails%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx)

- [ErrorMessage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceresponse.errormessage%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx)

- [ErrorProperties](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceresponse.errorproperties%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx)

- [Result](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceresponse.result%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx)

These properties contain information about why the email messages could not be processed as requested. The examples in this article print out the **Result**, **ErrorCode**, and **ErrorMessage** for each failed message. You can use these results to investigate the issue.

For EWS, to verify the success of a batched process, check the [ResponseClass](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bf57265a-d354-4cd7-bbfc-d93e19cbede6%28Office.15%29.aspx) attribute for each item being processed. The following is the basic structure of the **ResponseMessageType**, the base type from which all response messages are derived.

```XML
<ResponseMessage ResponseClass="Success | Warning | Error">
            <MessageText/>
            <ResponseCode/>
            <DescriptiveLinkKey/>
            <MessageXml/>
</ResponseMessage>
```

The **ResponseClass** attribute is set to **Success** if the email was processed successfully, or **Error** if the email was not processed successfully. For email messages, you will not encounter a **Warning** during batch processing. If the **ResponseClass** is **Success**, the [ResponseCode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4b84d670-74c9-4d6d-84e7-f0a9f76f0d93%28Office.15%29.aspx) element that follows is also always set to **NoError**. If the **ResponseClass** is **Error**, you need to check the values of the [MessageText](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/59a23bdc-0d9a-4942-8b3c-9cdb11db1ab1%28Office.15%29.aspx), **ResponseCode**, and [MessageXml](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bcaf9e35-d351-48f3-baad-f90c633cba8a%28Office.15%29.aspx) elements to determine what caused the problem. [DescriptiveLinkKey](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f7f36749-00f3-4915-b17c-e3caa0af6e67%28Office.15%29.aspx) is currently unused.
