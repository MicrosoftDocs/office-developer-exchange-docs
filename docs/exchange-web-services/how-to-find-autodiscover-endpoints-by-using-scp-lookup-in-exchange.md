# Find Autodiscover endpoints by using SCP lookup in Exchange

Find out how to locate Autodiscover SCP objects in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and use them to find Autodiscover endpoint URLs to use with the Exchange Autodiscover service.
  
Autodiscover makes it easy to retrieve information that you need to connect to mailboxes on Exchange servers. However, in order to use Autodiscover, you need a way to find Autodiscover servers that are appropriate for the user you're retrieving settings for. Service connection point (SCP) objects in AD DS provide an easy way for domain-joined clients to look up Autodiscover servers. 
  
## Get set up to find Autodiscover endpoints
<a name="bk_PreReqs"> </a>

To locate Autodiscover SCP objects in AD DS, you need to have access to the following:
  
- A server that is running a version of Exchange on-premises starting with Exchange 2007 SP1.
    
- A client computer that is joined to the domain that the Exchange server is installed in.
    
- A user account that has a mailbox on the Exchange server. 
    
Also, before you begin, you'll want to be familiar some basic concepts. The following are some resources that you'll find helpful.

## Locate Autodiscover SCP objects in AD DS
<a name="bk_LocateScpObjects"> </a>

The first step toward finding Autodiscover endpoints published in AD DS is to locate the Autodiscover SCP objects. Exchange publishes two types of SCP objects for Autodiscover:
  
- **SCP pointers** — These contain information that points to specific LDAP servers that should be used to locate Autodiscover SCP objects for the user's domain. SCP pointers are stamped with the following GUID: 67661d7F-8FC4-4fa7-BFAC-E1D7794C1F68. 
    
- **SCP URLs** — These contain URLs for Autodiscover endpoints. SCP URLs are stamped with the following GUID: 77378F46-2C66-4aa9-A6A6-3E7A48B19596. 
    
### To locate Autodiscover SCP objects

1. Read the **configurationNamingContext** property of the root DSE entry in AD DS to get the path to the configuration naming context for the domain. You can do this by using the [DirectoryEntry](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/z9cddzaa) class, or any other API that can acces AD DS. 
    
2. Search for SCP objects in the configuration naming context that have either the SCP pointer GUID or the SCP URL GUID in the **keywords** property. 
    
3. Check the SCP objects you found for an SCP pointer that is scoped to the user's domain by checking the **keywords** property for an entry equal to `"Domain=<domain>"`. For example, if the user's email address is elvin@contoso.com, you would look for an SCP pointer with an entry in the **keywords** property that is equal to `"Domain=contoso.com"`. If a matching SCP pointer is found, discard the set of SCP objects and start over at step 1 using the value of the **serviceBindingInformation** property as the server to connect to for the Root DSE entry. 
    
4. If you don't find any SCP pointers scoped to the user's domain, check for any SCP pointers that aren't scoped to any domain, and save the value of the **serviceBindingInformation** property as a "fallback" server, in case the current server doesn't give you any results. 
    
5. If you didn't find any SCP pointers scoped to the domain, you're ready to move on to the next step: generating a prioritized list of Autodiscover endpoints from your results.
    
## Generate a prioritized list of Autodiscover endpoints
<a name="bk_GenerateList"> </a>

You can generate a prioritized list of Autodiscover endpoint URLs, using the set of SCP objects that you located, by doing the following:
  
1. Get the Active Directory site name of the client computer.
    
2. Check the **keywords** property on each SCP URL in the set of SCP objects you found, and assign a priority to the URL based on the following rules: 
    
  - If the **keywords** property contains a value of `"Site=<site name>"`, where `<site name>` equals the name of the Active Directory site you retrieved in the previous step, assign the URL a priority of 1. 
    
  - If the **keywords** property does not contain an entry with a value that starts with `"Site="`, assign the URL a priority of 2. 
    
  - If the **keywords** property contains a value of `"Site=<site name>`, where `<site name>` does not equal the name of the Active Directory site you retrieved in the previous step, assign the URL a priority of 3. 
    
## Code example: Performing an SCP lookup

In the following code example, you'll see how to locate Autodiscover SCP objects and generate a prioritized list of Autodiscover endpoints.
