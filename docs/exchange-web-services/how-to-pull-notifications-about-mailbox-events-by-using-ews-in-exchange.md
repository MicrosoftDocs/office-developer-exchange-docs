# Pull notifications about mailbox events by using EWS in Exchange

Find out how to use the EWS Managed API or EWS to subscribe to pull notifications and get events.
  
EWS in Exchange uses pull notifications to enable clients to request (or pull) notifications about changes to the mailbox from the server to the client.
  
If you're subscribing to pull notifications by using the EWS Managed API, you [subscribe to and get pull notifications](how-to-pull-notifications-about-mailbox-events-by-using-ews-in-exchange.md#bk_cepullewsma) by using the [SubscribeToPullNotifications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice.subscribetopullnotifications%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method. You then get events from the server by using the [GetEvents](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.pullsubscription.getevents%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method. 
  
To subscribe to pull notifications by using EWS, you [create a subscription](how-to-pull-notifications-about-mailbox-events-by-using-ews-in-exchange.md#bk_cepullews) by using the [Subscribe operation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f17c3d08-c79e-41f1-ba31-6e41e7aafd87%28Office.15%29.aspx), parse the response, and then [get the notifications](how-to-pull-notifications-about-mailbox-events-by-using-ews-in-exchange.md#bk_getpull) by using the [GetEvents operation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f268efe5-9a1a-41a2-b6a6-51fcde7720a1%28Office.15%29.aspx).
  
After the client receives notifications of items that are changed or created on the server, it can then [synchronize the changes](how-to-pull-notifications-about-mailbox-events-by-using-ews-in-exchange.md#bk_nextsteps).
  
## Subscribe to and get pull notifications by using the EWS Managed API

The following code example shows how to use the [SubscribeToPullNotifications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice.subscribetopullnotifications%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method to subscribe to pull notifications for all events in the Inbox folder. The example then uses the [GetEvents](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.pullsubscription.getevents%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method to retrieve events from the server. In this example, we assume that **service** is a valid [ExchangeService](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) binding. 
  
```cs
// Subscribe to pull notifications in the Inbox.
PullSubscription subscription = service.SubscribeToPullNotifications( 
    new FolderId[] { WellKnownFolderName.Inbox }, 30, null, 
    EventType.NewMail, EventType.Created, EventType.Deleted,
    EventType.Modified, EventType.Moved, EventType.Copied, EventType.FreeBusyChanged); 
 
// Call GetEvents to retrieve events from the server. 
GetEventsResults events = subscription.GetEvents(); 
```

After you receive an event from the server, you can [synchronize those changes with the server](how-to-pull-notifications-about-mailbox-events-by-using-ews-in-exchange.md#bk_nextsteps). Use one of the unsubscribe methods specified in [How do I unsubscribe to notifications?](notification-subscriptions-mailbox-events-and-ews-in-exchange.md#bk_notifunsubscribe) to end the subscription with the server when the subscription is no longer needed. 
  
## Subscribe to pull notifications by using EWS
<a name="bk_cepullews"> </a>

The following example shows the XML request to send to the server to subscribe to all [EventTypes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/29ded9e5-f191-4aa3-bc3e-500de2fc8818%28Office.15%29.aspx) in the Inbox folder by using the [Subscribe operation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f17c3d08-c79e-41f1-ba31-6e41e7aafd87%28Office.15%29.aspx). This is also the XML request that the EWS Managed API sends when subscribing to pull notifications by using the [SubscribeToPullNotifications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice.subscribetopullnotifications%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method. 
  
```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Subscribe xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
           xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
  <PullSubscriptionRequest xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages">
    <FolderIds xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types">
      <DistinguishedFolderId Id="inbox" />
    </FolderIds>
    <EventTypes xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types">
            <EventType>NewMailEvent</EventType>
            <EventType>CreatedEvent</EventType>
            <EventType>DeletedEvent</EventType>
            <EventType>ModifiedEvent</EventType>
            <EventType>MovedEvent</EventType>
            <EventType>CopiedEvent</EventType>
            <EventType>FreeBusyChangedEvent</EventType>
    </EventTypes>
    <Timeout xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types">30</Timeout>
  </PullSubscriptionRequest>
</Subscribe>
```

The following XML example shows the [SubscribeResponse](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/fd87e9b7-c231-44fa-9f5b-19ae96cda5cc%28Office.15%29.aspx) message that is sent from the server to the client in response to the **Subscribe** operation request. The inclusion of the NoError value for the [ResponseCode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4b84d670-74c9-4d6d-84e7-f0a9f76f0d93%28Office.15%29.aspx) element means that the subscription was created successfully. The [SubscriptionId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/77c0abab-69e8-428e-8c20-22258e4ef71b%28Office.15%29.aspx) element uniquely identifies the pull notification subscription on the server. The [Watermark](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e1545046-94f9-4ac7-af1c-ea81dfb6822c%28Office.15%29.aspx) element represents a bookmark in the mailbox event queue. 
  
```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<SubscribeResponse xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
                   xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
  <ResponseMessages xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages">
    <SubscribeResponseMessage ResponseClass="Success">
      <ResponseCode>NoError</ResponseCode>
      <SubscriptionId>d581ab79-a2ec-4653-9c8e-564d7cfc1d8c</SubscriptionId>
      <Watermark>AAAAAGUhAAAAAAAAAQ==</Watermark>
    </SubscribeResponseMessage>
  </ResponseMessages>
</SubscribeResponse>
```

After creating the subscription, you can now get events by using the **SubscriptionId** that is returned in the **SubscribeResponse** message.

The following XML example shows the [GetEvents operation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f268efe5-9a1a-41a2-b6a6-51fcde7720a1%28Office.15%29.aspx) request message that is sent from the client to the server to get notifications for the [SubscriptionId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/77c0abab-69e8-428e-8c20-22258e4ef71b%28Office.15%29.aspx) that is returned in the [SubscribeResponse](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/fd87e9b7-c231-44fa-9f5b-19ae96cda5cc%28Office.15%29.aspx) message. For the first **GetEvents** request, use the [Watermark](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e1545046-94f9-4ac7-af1c-ea81dfb6822c%28Office.15%29.aspx) returned in the **Subscribe** response. For subsequent **GetEvents** requests, use the last **Watermark** that was returned in the previous **GetEvents** request. 
  
```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<GetEvents xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
               xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
  <SubscriptionId xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages">d581ab79-a2ec-4653-9c8e-564d7cfc1d8c</SubscriptionId>
  <Watermark xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages">AAAAAGUhAAAAAAAAAQ==</Watermark>
</GetEvents>
```

The following XML example shows the **GetEvents** response message that is sent from the server to the client. Each **GetEvents** response includes information about one or more events. A **Watermark** is returned for each event. The last **Watermark** must be saved and used in the next **GetEvents** request. If no store events have occurred since the last **GetEvents** request, a status event is returned. 
  
```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<GetEventsResponseType xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
                       xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
  <ResponseMessages xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages">
    <GetEventsResponseMessage ResponseClass="Success">
      <ResponseCode>NoError</ResponseCode>
      <Notification>
        <SubscriptionId xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types">d581ab79-a2ec-4653-9c8e-564d7cfc1d8c</SubscriptionId>
        <PreviousWatermark xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types">AAAAAGUhAAAAAAAAAQ==</PreviousWatermark>
        <MoreEvents xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types">false</MoreEvents>
        <NewMailEvent xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types">
          <Watermark>AAAAAHMhAAAAAAAAAQ==</Watermark>
          <TimeStamp>2013-09-15T21:37:01Z</TimeStamp>
          <ItemId Id="AAAtA=" ChangeKey="CQAAAA==" />
          <ParentFolderId Id="AQAtAEFkbWA==" ChangeKey="AQAAAA==" />
        </NewMailEvent>
      </Notification>
    </GetEventsResponseMessage>
  </ResponseMessages>
</GetEventsResponse>
```

After you receive an event from the server, [synchronize the changes to the client](how-to-pull-notifications-about-mailbox-events-by-using-ews-in-exchange.md#bk_nextsteps). Use the [Unsubscribe operation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/994a9d2b-1501-4804-90f0-12bd914496ec%28Office.15%29.aspx) to end the subscription with the server when the subscription is no longer needed.
