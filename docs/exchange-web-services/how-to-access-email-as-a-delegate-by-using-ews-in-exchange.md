# Access email as a delegate by using EWS in Exchange

Learn how to access email as a delegate by using the EWS Managed API or EWS in Exchange.
  
You can use the EWS Managed API or EWS to give a user delegate access to a mailbox owner's Inbox folder. The delegate can then create meeting requests on behalf of the mailbox owner, search for email, and retrieve, update, and delete email from the mailbox owner's Inbox folder, depending on their permissions.
  
As a delegate, you use the same methods and operations to access a mailbox owner's Inbox folder that you use to access an Inbox folder without delegate access. The main difference is that you have to use [explicit access](delegate-access-and-ews-in-exchange.md#bk_explicit) to find or create an email item, and then after you identify the item ID, you can use [implicit access](delegate-access-and-ews-in-exchange.md#bk_implicit) to get, update, or delete the item.

Keep the following things in mind when working with emails as a delegate:
  
- If a delegate only needs to work with meeting requests and responses, the delegate does not need access to the Inbox folder. For more information, see [prerequisite tasks for accessing calendars as a delegate](how-to-access-a-calendar-as-a-delegate-by-using-ews-in-exchange.md#bk_prereq).

- When a recipient receives a message that was sent on behalf of a mailbox owner, the sender appears as "*Delegate* on behalf of *mailbox owner*."

> [!NOTE]
> In the code examples in this article, <primary@contoso.com> is the mailbox owner.
  
## Prerequisite tasks

<a name="bk_prereq"> </a>

Before a user can access the mailbox owner's Inbox folder as a delegate, the user must be [added as a delegate with permissions](how-to-add-and-remove-delegates-by-using-ews-in-exchange.md) to the mailbox owner's Inbox folder.
  
## Create and send an email as a delegate by using the EWS Managed API

<a name="bk_createewsma"> </a>

The EWS Managed API enables you to use the service object for the delegate user to create and send email on behalf of the mailbox owner. This example shows how to use the [Save](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd635209%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method to save the message in the mailbox owner's Drafts folder, and then the [SendAndSaveCopy](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd634248%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method to send the mail and save the message in the mailbox owner's Sent Items folder.
  
This example assumes that **service** is a valid [ExchangeService](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object for the delegate and that the delegate has been granted the [appropriate permissions for the mailbox owner's Inbox, Drafts, and Sent Items folder](how-to-set-folder-permissions-for-another-user-by-using-ews-in-exchange.md).
  
```cs
public static void DelegateAccessCreateEmail(ExchangeService service)
{
    // Create an email message and provide it with connection 
    // configuration information by using an ExchangeService 
    // object named service.
    EmailMessage message = new EmailMessage(service);
    // Set properties on the email message.
    message.Subject = "Company Soccer Team";
    message.Body = "Are you interested in joining?";
    message.ToRecipients.Add("sadie@contoso.com");
    // Save the email to the mailbox owner's Drafts folder.
    // This method call results in a CreateItem call to EWS.
    // The FolderId parameter contains the context for the 
    // mailbox owner's Inbox folder. Any additional actions 
    // taken on this message will be performed in the mailbox 
    // owner's mailbox. 
    message.Save(new FolderId(WellKnownFolderName.Drafts, new Mailbox("primary@contoso.com")));
    // Send the email and save the message in the mailbox owner's 
    // Sent Items folder.
    // This method call results in a SendItem call to EWS.
    message.SendAndSaveCopy(new FolderId(WellKnownFolderName.SentItems, new Mailbox("primary@contoso.com")));
    Console.WriteLine("An email with the subject '" + message.Subject + "' has been sent to '" 
    + message.ToRecipients[0] + "' and saved in the Sent Items folder of the mailbox owner.");
}
```

## Create and send an email as a delegate by using EWS

<a name="bk_createews"> </a>

EWS enables you to use the service object for the delegate user to create and send email on behalf of the mailbox owner. This example shows how to use the [CreateItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa4a7c94-f668-4bd2-8079-c855f6ab17e1%28Office.15%29.aspx) operation to create an email and the [SendItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/337b89ef-e1b7-45ed-92f3-8abe4200e4c7%28Office.15%29.aspx) operation to send the time and save it in the mailbox owner's Sent Items folder.
  
This is also the first XML request that the EWS Managed API sends when you use the **Save** method to [create and send an email](#bk_createewsma).

```

The server responds to the **CreateItem** request with a [CreateItemResponse](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/742a46a0-2475-45a0-b44f-90639a3f5a43%28Office.15%29.aspx) message that includes a [ResponseCode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4b84d670-74c9-4d6d-84e7-f0a9f76f0d93%28Office.15%29.aspx) element value of **NoError**, which indicates that the email was created and saved successfully. The response also contains the item ID of the newly created email.
  
The **ItemId** value has been shortened for readability.

Next, use the **SendItem** operation to send the message on behalf of the mailbox owner and save it in the mailbox owner's Sent Items folder.
  
The **ItemId** value has been shortened for readability.

## Search for an email as a delegate by using the EWS Managed API

<a name="bk_searchewsma"> </a>

To search for an email, you must use one of the [ExchangeService.FindItems](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice.finditems%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) methods that includes a [FolderId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.folderid%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) parameter, so that you can specify the mailbox owner's Inbox folder.
  
```cs
static void DelegateAccessSearchEmailWithFilter(ExchangeService service)
{
    // Limit the result set to 10 items.
    ItemView view = new ItemView(10);
    // Define the search filter.
    SearchFilter.ContainsSubstring filter = new SearchFilter.ContainsSubstring(ItemSchema.Subject, 
        "soccer", ContainmentMode.Substring, ComparisonMode.IgnoreCase);
    view.PropertySet = new PropertySet(ItemSchema.Subject,
                                       ItemSchema.DateTimeReceived,
                                       EmailMessageSchema.IsRead);
    // Item searches do not support deep traversal.
    view.Traversal = ItemTraversal.Shallow;
    // Sorting.
    view.OrderBy.Add(ItemSchema.DateTimeReceived, SortDirection.Descending);
    try
    {
        // Call FindItems to find matching Inbox items. 
        // The parameters of FindItems must denote the mailbox owner,
        // mailbox, and Inbox folder.
        // This call results in a FindItem call to EWS.
        FindItemsResults<Item> results = service.FindItems(new 
            FolderId(WellKnownFolderName.Inbox, "primary@contoso.com"), 
            filter, view);
        foreach (Item item in results.Items)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Subject: {0}", item.Subject);
            Console.WriteLine("Id: {0}", item.Id.ToString());
            if (item is EmailMessage)
            {
                EmailMessage message = item as EmailMessage;
                Console.WriteLine("Read: {0}", message.IsRead.ToString());
            }
        }
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Exception while enumerating results: {0}", ex.Message);
    }
}
```

After the **FindItems** call returns a response with an ID, you can get, update or delete that email by using the ID and [implicit access](delegate-access-and-ews-in-exchange.md#bk_implicit) - and you do not need to specify the mailbox owner's SMTP address.
  
## Search for an email as a delegate by using EWS

<a name="bk_searchews"> </a>

EWS enables you to use the service object for the delegate user to search for emails that meet a set of search criteria. This example shows how to use the [FindItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ebad6aae-16e7-44de-ae63-a95b24539729%28Office.15%29.aspx) operation to find messages in the owner's Inbox folder that contain the word "soccer" in the subject.
  
This is also the XML request that the EWS Managed API sends when you [search for an email](#bk_searchewsma).

The server responds to the **FindItem** request with a [FindItemResponse](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c8b316df-d4ab-49b8-96d4-8e9a016730ef%28Office.15%29.aspx) message that includes a [ResponseCode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4b84d670-74c9-4d6d-84e7-f0a9f76f0d93%28Office.15%29.aspx) element value of **NoError**, which indicates that the search completed successfully. The response contains a [Message](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/2400b33c-43b2-4fc2-b6fb-275a99e0e810%28Office.15%29.aspx) element for any emails that met the search criteria. In this case, only one email is found.
  
The value of the [ItemId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/3350b597-57a0-4961-8f44-8624946719b4%28Office.15%29.aspx) element has been shortened for readability.

Now that you have the **ItemId** for the email that meets your criteria, you can get, update, or delete that email by using the **ItemId** and [implicit access](delegate-access-and-ews-in-exchange.md#bk_implicit) - and you do not need to specify the mailbox owner's SMTP address.
  
## Get, update, or delete email items as a delegate by using the EWS Managed API

<a name="bk_geteswma"> </a>

You can use the EWS Managed API to get, update, or delete an email in the same way that you perform these actions when you're not using delegate access. The only difference is that the **ExchangeService** object is for the delegate user. The item ID included in the **Bind** method call uniquely identifies the item in the mailbox store, in the mailbox owner's Inbox folder.

## Get, update, or delete email items as a delegate by using EWS

<a name="bk_getews"> </a>

You can use the EWS Managed API to get, update, or delete an email in the same way that you perform these actions when you're not using delegate access. The only difference is that the service object is for the delegate user. The item ID included in the **GetItem** request uniquely identifies the item in the mailbox store, in the mailbox owner's Inbox folder.
