# Verifying the results of an EWS or EWS Managed API call

Learn how to verify the results of your EWS or EWS Managed API calls.
  
When things aren't working correctly, it helps to see what's going on by examining the SOAP requests that your application is sending over the network and the responses that the server is sending back. The [tools and resources for troubleshooting EWS applications](tools-and-resources-for-troubleshooting-ews-applications-for-exchange.md) article includes links to tools to help capture and view those SOAP requests. After you've got the requests and the responses, how do you verify that the request you sent to the server was processed correctly? Read on to find out. 
  
If you're sending EWS requests, you're going to start your verification by checking the **ResponseClass** attribute for each response message in the response. That will tell you whether the operation completed successfully on each item. 
  
Depending on the object that your method is calling, if you're using the EWS Managed API to send requests, you can do some verification using the response objects. But because the SOAP response contains a superset of what's included in the EWS Managed API response objects, you might want to look at the SOAP response as well. Because the SOAP response can often contain more information than the EWS Managed API response objects, start your verification with the SOAP response.
  
## Verifying the results of a SOAP response
<a name="bk_verifysoap"> </a>

When you receive a SOAP response, the first thing to look at is the **ResponseClass** attribute. This attribute is included in each **ResponseMessageType** instance in the [ResponseMessages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/2071bed8-ea66-4627-aa4f-a1d9a025cf3d%28Office.15%29.aspx) element, as shown in the following example. 
  
```XML
<s:Body>
      <m:GetItemResponse xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages"
                         xmlns:t="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types">
        <m:ResponseMessages>
          <m:GetItemResponseMessage ResponseClass="Success">
          …
```

Because a SOAP response might contain multiple response messages in a single SOAP response, it's important to check each response message individually.
  
If you're working with an operation that includes a **ResponseClass** as part of the operation response, like the following, you might be tempted to only check the **ResponseClass** of the operation. 
  
```XML
<soap:Body>
  <m:AddDelegateResponse xmlns:t="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types"
                         ResponseClass="Success"
                         xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages">
  …

```

However, the operation status only reflects the shape of the top-level response and does not reflect the status of all the individual message responses. In the following example, the [AddDelegateResponse](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/d7e6bebb-5dbf-43c1-aacf-4b3ca6a7c429%28Office.15%29.aspx) operation has a **ResponseClass** of **Success**, but the underlying [DelegateUserResponseMessageType](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/3dc9552c-1e2d-40ac-a137-827883c2bb88%28Office.15%29.aspx) element has a **ResponseClass** value of **Error**.
  
```XML
<soap:Body>
  <m:AddDelegateResponse xmlns:t="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types"
                         ResponseClass="Success"
                         xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages">
    <m:ResponseCode>NoError</m:ResponseCode>
    <m:ResponseMessages>
      <m:DelegateUserResponseMessageType ResponseClass="Error">
        <m:MessageText>The user is already a delegate for the mailbox.</m:MessageText>
        <m:ResponseCode>ErrorDelegateAlreadyExists</m:ResponseCode>
        <m:DescriptiveLinkKey>0</m:DescriptiveLinkKey>
      </m:DelegateUserResponseMessageType>
    </m:ResponseMessages>
  </m:AddDelegateResponse>
</soap:Body>
```

So for SOAP EWS responses, you can't rely on the **ResponseClass** of the operation - you have to look at the **ResponseClass** of each response message to determine whether the operation encountered any errors processing the items. 
  
### Verifying success

If each **ResponseClass** attribute for each **ResponseMessage** attribute is set to **Success**, the operation completed successfully on all the items, and you can move on to your next task.
  
The following example shows a successful response to a [GetItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e8492e3b-1c8d-4b14-8070-9530f8306edd%28Office.15%29.aspx) operation request to retrieve a single item. Note that when the **ResponseClass** is set to **Success**, the associated [ResponseCode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4b84d670-74c9-4d6d-84e7-f0a9f76f0d93%28Office.15%29.aspx) is always set to **NoError**.
  
```XML
<s:Body xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
             xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
      <m:GetItemResponse xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages"
                         xmlns:t="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types">
        <m:ResponseMessages>
          <m:GetItemResponseMessage ResponseClass="Success">
            <m:ResponseCode>NoError</m:ResponseCode>
            <m:Items>
              <t:Message>
                <t:ItemId Id="Er5bAAA=" 
                          ChangeKey="CQAAABYAAAD32nSTjepyT63rYH17n9THAAAhE0/M" />
                <t:Subject>Dinner Party</t:Subject>
              </t:Message>
            </m:Items>
          </m:GetItemResponseMessage>
        </m:ResponseMessages>
      </m:GetItemResponse>
    </s:Body>
```

The following is a successful response to a **GetItem** operation request to retrieve multiple items. Each of the [GetItemResponseMessage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc583723-54d1-4a17-8c1f-6586f70fdefd%28Office.15%29.aspx) elements has a **ResponseClass** of **Success**.
  
```XML
<s:Body xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
  <m:GetItemResponse xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages"
                     xmlns:t="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types">
    <m:ResponseMessages>
      <m:GetItemResponseMessage ResponseClass="Success">
        <m:ResponseCode>NoError</m:ResponseCode>
        <m:Items>
          <t:Message>
            <t:ItemId Id="Er5bAAA=" 
                      ChangeKey="CQAAABYAAAD32nSTjepyT63rYH17n9THAAAhE0/M" /
            <t:Subject>Dinner Party</t:Subject>
          </t:Message>
        </m:Items>
      </m:GetItemResponseMessage>
      <m:GetItemResponseMessage ResponseClass="Success">
        <m:ResponseCode>NoError</m:ResponseCode>
        <m:Items>
          <t:Message>
            <t:ItemId Id="3c66AAA="
                      ChangeKey="CQAAABYAAAD32nSTjepyT63rYH17n9THAAAc3kqm" />
            <t:Subject>Company Soccer Team</t:Subject>
          </t:Message>
        </m:Items>
      </m:GetItemResponseMessage>
    </m:ResponseMessages>
  </m:GetItemResponse>
</s:Body>
```

### Handling errors and warnings

When you receive a response and the **ResponseClass** attribute is set to **Error**, the operation did not complete successfully on one or more items. Correct the issue and retry your request, or the part of your request that failed. A **ResponseClass** attribute value of **Warning** value is only returned by the [ResolveNames](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6b4eb4b3-9ad6-4804-a09f-7e20cfea4dbb%28Office.15%29.aspx) operation, and indicates that the entity could not be resolved to a unique identity. You can ignore it for all other operations. 
  
In the following response, the **ResponseClass** attribute has a value of **Error**.
  
```XML
<m:GetItemResponseMessage ResponseClass="Error">
  <m:MessageText>Property is not valid for this object type.</m:MessageText>
  <m:ResponseCode>ErrorInvalidPropertyRequest</m:ResponseCode>
  <m:DescriptiveLinkKey>0</m:DescriptiveLinkKey>
  <m:MessageXml>
    <t:FieldURI FieldURI="meeting:AssociatedCalendarItemId" />
  </m:MessageXml>
  <m:Items />
</m:GetItemResponseMessage>
```

In this example, EWS provides clues to debug the issue. When the **ResponseClass** attribute has a value of **Error**, the following additional elements are included in the response when applicable:
  
- [MessageText](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/59a23bdc-0d9a-4942-8b3c-9cdb11db1ab1%28Office.15%29.aspx) — Describes the error. 
    
- [ResponseCode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4b84d670-74c9-4d6d-84e7-f0a9f76f0d93%28Office.15%29.aspx) — Contains the error code, which can be used to find additional troubleshooting resources. 
    
- [MessageXml](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bcaf9e35-d351-48f3-baad-f90c633cba8a%28Office.15%29.aspx) — Identifies the elements that caused the error. 
    
- [DescriptiveLinkKey](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f7f36749-00f3-4915-b17c-e3caa0af6e67%28Office.15%29.aspx) — Unused. 
    
You can use the information provided in these elements to investigate your issue. In the previous example, the **MessageText** indicates that the property isn't valid for the object type. The request was to get an email message, but the property set included the **AssociatedCalendarItemId**, which is only valid for appointment items.
  
The following example shows an error that was received as part of a batched operation to get multiple email items. The first item was retrieved successfully and the **ResponseClass** is set to **Success**. The second item could not be found, and the **ResponseClass** is set to **Error**.
  
```XML
<m:GetItemResponse xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages"
                        xmlns:t="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types">
  <m:ResponseMessages>
    <m:GetItemResponseMessage ResponseClass="Success">
      <m:ResponseCode>NoError</m:ResponseCode>
      <m:Items>
        <t:Message>
          <t:ItemId Id="Er5cAAA="
                    ChangeKey="CQAAABYAAAD32nSTjepyT63rYH17n9THAAAhE0/O" />
          <t:Subject>Business plans</t:Subject>
        </t:Message>
      </m:Items>
    </m:GetItemResponseMessage>
    <m:GetItemResponseMessage ResponseClass="Error">
      <m:MessageText>The specified object was not found in the store.</m:MessageText>
      <m:ResponseCode>ErrorItemNotFound</m:ResponseCode>
      <m:DescriptiveLinkKey>0</m:DescriptiveLinkKey>
      <m:Items />
    </m:GetItemResponseMessage>
  </m:ResponseMessages>
</m:GetItemResponse>
```

When one or more items in a batched request can't be processed as requested, an error is returned for each item that failed, and the rest of the items in the batch are processed as expected. Failures in batch processing can occur if the item was deleted, and therefore can't be sent, retrieved, or updated, or if the item moved to a different folder, and therefore has a new item ID. Because the operation will complete for some items and not return an error when one or more items can't be processed, it's important to check each **ResponseClass** attribute before you move on to your next operation.

## Verifying the results of an EWS Managed API method call
<a name="bk_successful"> </a>

If you're using the EWS Managed API and calling a method on an [ExchangeService](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object, your method will likely return a [ServiceResponseCollection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd633715%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object, which contains a collection of [ServiceResponse](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceresponse%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) objects, or a collection of objects derived from the **ServiceResponse** objects. The **ServiceResponseCollection** and included **ServiceResponse** objects contain information about the result of the method call, which you can use to verify your results. 
  
If you're using the EWS Managed API and calling a method on an [Item](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.item%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object, or one of the derived objects, the method likely does not return a response object to check for success, but does throw an [Exception](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c18k6c59) if the method does not complete successfully. 
  
### Verifying success

One benefit of using the EWS Managed API is that it provides an overall status when dealing with multiple items in one response. So if the method you called returns a **ServiceResponseCollection**, you can check that the [OverallResult](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd634515%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) property of the **ServiceResponseCollection** is equal to [ServiceResult.Success](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceresult%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx). If so, all the items in the batched process were completed successfully; you don't have to check each **ServiceResponse** object individually. If the **OverallResult** property is not set to **ServiceResult.Success**, you have to [handle the error or warning](#bk_ewsmaerrors).
  
If the method you're calling does not return a **ServiceResponseCollection**, but does return a **ServiceResponse** object, you have to check the value of the **Result** property. If the **Result** value is set to **Success**, you know the method completed successfully.
  
If the method you're calling has no return value, there's really no way to check for success via the EWS Managed API. As long as an exception is not thrown, you can assume the method completed successfully. For additional validation, you can also [check the SOAP response to verify the results](#bk_verifysoap).
  
### Handling errors, warnings, and exceptions
<a name="bk_ewsmaerrors"> </a>

If your EWS Managed API code throws an **Exception**, you can use the [Exception.Message](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/9btwf6wk) value to determine the source of the error. The **Message** property contains the contents of the [MessageText](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/59a23bdc-0d9a-4942-8b3c-9cdb11db1ab1%28Office.15%29.aspx) element in the underlying SOAP response. In addition, if the exception is of type [ServiceResponseException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceresponseexception%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object, one of the most common exceptions, you can also retrieve the [ErrorCode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceresponseexception.errorcode%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) contained in the underlying SOAP [ResponseCode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4b84d670-74c9-4d6d-84e7-f0a9f76f0d93%28Office.15%29.aspx) element, and the [Response](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceresponseexception.response%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) property that identifies the associated [ServiceResponse](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceresponse%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object. The following code shows how to catch and display the contents of a **ServiceResponseException**. 
  
```cs
try
    {
         …
    }
    catch (ServiceResponseException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Error code: " + ex.ErrorCode);
        Console.WriteLine("Error message: " + ex.Message);
        Console.WriteLine("Response: " + ex.Response);
    }
```

If the method you called returns a **ServiceResponseCollection**, and the value of the **OverallResult** property is equal to **Warning** or **Error**, you'll have to loop through each object in the **ServiceResponseCollection** to find the error. The **OverallResult** property is set to **Warning** if at least one response has its **Result** value set to **Warning** and all other responses have their **Result** values set to **Success**. The **OverallResult** property is set to **Error** if at least one response has its **Result** value set to **Error**. When the **OverallResult** is set to **Warning** or **Error**, the following properties are set on the **ServiceResponse** objects as appropriate: 
  
- [ErrorCode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceresponse.errorcode%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) — Contains the error code, which can be used to find additional troubleshooting resources. 
    
- [ErrorDetails](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceresponse.errordetails%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) — Contains details about the error for some **ErrorCodes**. For example, when the error code is **ErrorRecurrenceHasNoOccurrence**, the **ErrorDetails** will contain keys for **EffectiveStartDate** and **EffectiveEndDate**. 
    
- [ErrorMessage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceresponse.errormessage%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) — Describes the error. 
    
- [ErrorProperties](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceresponse.errorproperties%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) — If available, identifies the properties that caused the error. For example, when the error code is **ErrorInvalidPropertyForOperation**, **ErrorProperties** contains the definition of the property that was invalid for the request. 
    
- [Result](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceresponse.result%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) — Contains **Error** or **Warning** when an issue is encountered. 
    
If the information provided by the **ServiceResponse** properties doesn't provide enough information to correct your method call or unblock you, see [Next steps](#bk_nextsteps) to dig up more information on **ErrorCode** values.
