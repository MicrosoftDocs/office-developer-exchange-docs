# Handling notification-related errors in EWS in Exchange

Find out how to handle notification-related errors in applications that you develop by using the EWS Managed API or EWS in Exchange.

If your application subscribes to and gets notifications, you might have to handle notification-related errors. You can handle these errors at runtime, or while you are developing your EWS application.

**Table 1. Notification-related errors and how to handle them**

This is the value of mailbox subscriptions, not the number of individual folder subscriptions in a mailbox subscription. Starting with service mailbox versions 14.16.0135 and 14.15.0057.000, a mailbox hosted by Exchange Online or Exchange Online as part of Office 365 can have up to 20 subscriptions, and a target Exchange 2013 on-premises mailbox can have up to 5000 subscriptions.</li><li>The [EwsMaxConcurrency](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.data.directory.systemconfiguration.throttlingpolicy.ewsmaxconcurrency%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx) throttling limit identifies the maximum number of active requests for non-streaming connections and has a default value of 27.</li><li>The default limit for open streaming connections is ten.</li></ul> |<ul><li>[Considering the implications of the notification-related throttling policies](ews-throttling-in-exchange.md#throttling-considerations-for-ews-notification-applications) and limiting the number of active subscriptions and active connections so that the application is not throttled.</li><li>Using fewer connections to get events.

## Recovering from lost subscriptions
<a name="bk_recover"> </a>

When a subscription is lost, or is no longer accessible, it is best to create a new subscription and not include the old watermark in the new subscription. Resubscribing with the old watermark causes a linear scan for events, which is costly. Instead, create a new subscription and compare folder properties to look for content changes that occurred between the lost subscription and the new subscription. The extended folder properties that we recommend that you check are **PR_LOCAL_COMMIT_TIME_MAX** (0x670a0040) and **PR_DELETED_COUNT_TOTAL** (0x670b0003). You can do this by [creating an extended property definition](properties-and-extended-properties-in-ews-in-exchange.md).
