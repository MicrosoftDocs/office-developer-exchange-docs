# Update a recurring series by using EWS

Learn how to modify appointments in a recurring series by using the EWS Managed API or EWS in Exchange.
  
You can use the EWS Managed API or EWS to update a recurring series by either [updating the entire series](how-to-update-a-recurring-series-by-using-ews-in-exchange.md), or by updating a single occurrence. In this article we'll discuss how to update a single occurrence.
  
Modifying a single appointment in a series is very similar to [modifying a single instance appointment](how-to-update-appointments-and-meetings-by-using-ews-in-exchange.md). You use the same methods and operations, but you use the item ID of the occurrence you want to change.
  
When you change a single occurrence in a series, that occurrence is added to an array of modified appointments associated with the recurring master for the series. You can use the [Appointment.ModifiedOccurrences](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.appointment.modifiedoccurrences%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) EWS Managed API property or the [ModifiedOccurrences](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/552932fc-b3b4-486e-8d73-32c0bb10bd68%28Office.15%29.aspx) EWS element to access all the appointments in a series that have been modified.
  
## Modify a single occurrence in a series by using the EWS Managed API
 
1. Bind to the occurrence you want to modify by using either the [Appointment.BindToOccurrence](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.appointment.bindtooccurrence%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method with the item's index value, or the [Appointment.Bind](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.appointment.bind%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method with the occurrence's ID. You obtain this ID from either the [Id](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.item.id%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) property of an [Appointment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.appointment%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object that corresponds to the occurrence, or from the [ItemId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.occurrenceinfo.itemid%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) property of the [OccurrenceInfo](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.occurrenceinfo%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object that corresponds to the occurrence.

2. Update the properties on the occurrence's Appointment object.

3. Save the changes to the occurrence's appointment object by using the [Appointment.Save](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.appointment.save%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method.

The following example updates an appointment in a recurring series and verifies that the modified appointment is updated on the recurring master. This example assumes that you have authenticated to an Exchange server and have acquired an [ExchangeService](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object named **service**. The `recurrenceMasterId` parameter is an identifier associated with the recurring master for the occurrence to modify.
  
```cs
public static ItemId ModifyARecurringSeries(ExchangeService service, ItemId recurrenceMasterId)
{
    Appointment calendarItem = Appointment.Bind(service, recurrenceMasterId, new PropertySet(AppointmentSchema.AppointmentType));
    Appointment recurrMaster = new Appointment(service);
    if (calendarItem.AppointmentType == AppointmentType.RecurringMaster)
    {
        // Get the recurring master from an occurrence in a recurring series with the properties you need.
        recurrMaster = Appointment.Bind(service,
                                        recurrenceMasterId,
                                        new PropertySet(AppointmentSchema.AppointmentType,
                                                        AppointmentSchema.Subject,
                                                        AppointmentSchema.FirstOccurrence,
                                                        AppointmentSchema.LastOccurrence,
                                                        AppointmentSchema.ModifiedOccurrences,
                                                        AppointmentSchema.DeletedOccurrences));
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Item id was not for a recurring master.");
        return recurrenceMasterId;
    }
    // Bind to the second occurrence in the series with the properties to modify.
    Appointment occurrenceToModify = Appointment.BindToOccurrence(service,
                                                                    recurrMaster.Id,
                                                                    2,
                                                                    new PropertySet(AppointmentSchema.Location,
                                                                                    AppointmentSchema.Start,
                                                                                    AppointmentSchema.End,
                                                                                    AppointmentSchema.RequiredAttendees,
                                                                                    AppointmentSchema.Subject));
    // Update the properties you want to change.
    occurrenceToModify.Location = "Helipad of Contoso Bldg 1";
    occurrenceToModify.Start = occurrenceToModify.Start.AddDays(1);
    occurrenceToModify.End = occurrenceToModify.End.AddDays(1);
    occurrenceToModify.RequiredAttendees.Add("Contoso CEO", "sadie@contoso");
    occurrenceToModify.RequiredAttendees.Add("Contoso Head of Research", "ronnie@contoso.com");
    occurrenceToModify.RequiredAttendees.Add("Contoso Head of Security", "alfred@contoso.com");
    occurrenceToModify.Subject = occurrenceToModify.Subject.ToString() + ":Mandatory";
    // Update the occurrence in your calendar folder and send meeting update requests to attendees.
    // This method call results in an UpdateItem request to EWS.
    occurrenceToModify.Update(ConflictResolutionMode.AlwaysOverwrite, SendInvitationsOrCancellationsMode.SendToAllAndSaveCopy);
    // View updated and deleted occurrences on the recurring master prior to retrieving updated information.
    Console.WriteLine("Modified Occurrences prior to updating recurring master: {0}",
                    (recurrMaster.ModifiedOccurrences == null ? "None" : recurrMaster.ModifiedOccurrences.Count.ToString()));
    // Update the recurring master to view the modified and deleted occurrences.
    recurrMaster = Appointment.Bind(service, recurrenceMasterId, new PropertySet(AppointmentSchema.ModifiedOccurrences,
                                                                        AppointmentSchema.DeletedOccurrences));
    // View updated and deleted occurrences on the recurring master after retrieving updated information.
    Console.WriteLine("Modified Occurrences after updating recurring master:\t {0}",
                    (recurrMaster.ModifiedOccurrences == null ? "None" : recurrMaster.ModifiedOccurrences.Count.ToString()));
    return recurrMaster.Id;            
}

```

## Modify a single occurrence in a series by using EWS

Modifying a single instance in a series is essentially the same as modifying a single instance appointment. You can specify the occurrence to change by using either an [ItemId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/3350b597-57a0-4961-8f44-8624946719b4%28Office.15%29.aspx) or an [OccurrenceItemId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4a15bbc3-5b93-4193-b9ec-da32f0a9a552%28Office.15%29.aspx) element.
  
The following example shows the request XML when you use the [UpdateItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/5d027523-e0bc-4da2-b60b-0cb9fc1fdfe4%28Office.15%29.aspx) operation to update an occurrence in a recurring series of appointments. The **ItemId** and **ChangeKey** are shortened for readability.
