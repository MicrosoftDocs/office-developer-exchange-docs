# Pull notifications for EWS deletion-related mailbox events in Exchange

Discover which mailbox events are raised when you delete items by using EWS in Exchange.
  
When you [delete items and folders from a mailbox](deleting-items-by-using-ews-in-exchange.md), this triggers a mailbox event. Different versions of Exchange return different mailbox events in response to changes to items and folders in a mailbox. The following table identifies the mailbox events that are returned for deletions when you use pull notifications to subscribe to mailbox events. 
  
**Table 1: Deletion-related mailbox events for pull notifications**

|**Type of deletion and the EWS operation**|**Exchange 2010 notification when you specify each folder identifier**|**Exchange 2010 notification when you specify all folders**|**Exchange Online and Exchange 2013 notification when you specify each folder identifier**|**Exchange Online and Exchange 2013 when you specify all folders**|
