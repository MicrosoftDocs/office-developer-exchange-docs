# Handling delegation-related errors in EWS in Exchange

Find out how to handle delegation-related errors in applications that you develop by using the EWS Managed API or EWS in Exchange.
  
If your application uses delegation or adds or removes delegates, you might have to handle delegation-related errors. You can handle these errors at runtime, or while you are developing your EWS application. These errors are defined by the EWS Managed API [ServiceError](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.serviceerror%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) enumeration and the EWS [ResponseCode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4b84d670-74c9-4d6d-84e7-f0a9f76f0d93%28Office.15%29.aspx) element.
