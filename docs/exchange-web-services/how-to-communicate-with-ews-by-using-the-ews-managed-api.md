# Communicate with EWS by using the EWS Managed API

Find information about how to use the EWS Managed API to communicate with EWS in Exchange.
  
The [ExchangeService](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) class in the EWS Managed API contains the methods and properties that you use to set user credentials, identify the EWS endpoint, send and receive SOAP messages, and configure the binding to communicate with EWS. Before you can use the EWS Managed API to perform any task, you have to create an instance of the **ExchangeService** class and bind it to EWS. 
  
After you set up an [ExchangeService](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices.Data.ExchangeService.aspx) object with user credentials and the EWS endpoint, any mailbox object that references the [ExchangeService](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices.Data.ExchangeService.aspx) object can use the following method types to communicate with EWS: 
  
- ExchangeService object methods â€” All the methods on the **ExchangeService** object that are not inherited from the base **Object** type make calls to EWS. 
    
- Exchange mailbox item and folder type methods.

## To use the EWS Managed API to communicate with EWS

1. Instantiate the **ExchangeService** class. 
    
   ```csharp
    ExchangeService service = new ExchangeService();
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Instantiating **ExchangeService** with an empty constructor will create an instance that is bound to the latest known version of Exchange. Alternatively, you can target a specific version of Exchange by specifying version as a parameter. `ExchangeService service = new ExchangeService(ExchangeVersion.Exchange2007_SP1);`
  
2. Set the credentials of the user who sends requests to the Exchange server. If you want to connect to EWS from a computer that is logged on to the domain, using the credentials of the authenticated user, set the **UseDefaultCredentials** property on the **ExchangeService** object to **true**.
    
   ```cs
    // Connect by using the default credentials of the authenticated user.
    service.UseDefaultCredentials = true;
   ```

   If you do not want to connect by using the default user credentials, set the **Credentials** property on the **ExchangeService** object to explicitly specify the credentials of a different user. If you are using Exchange Online or Exchange Online as part of Office 365, you'll use basic authentication, with just a user name and password. A domain name is required for NTLM authentication. 
    
   ```cs
    // Connect by using the credentials of user1 at contoso.com.
    service.Credentials = new WebCredentials("user1@contoso.com", "password");
   ```

   You can also specify the credentials of the user by using the user's domain name and password.
    
   ```cs
    // Connect by using the credentials of contoso/user1.
    service.Credentials = new WebCredentials("user1", "password", "contoso");
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the **UseDefaultCredentials** property is set to **true**, the value of the **Credentials** property is ignored. 
  
3. Set the URL of the EWS endpoint. This URL locates the exchange.asmx file on Client Access server.
    
   ```cs
    // Use Autodiscover to set the URL endpoint.
    service.AutodiscoverUrl("user1@contoso.com");
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   >  Although you can explicitly set the **Url** property of the **ExchangeService** to a hardcoded value, we recommend that you use the Autodiscover service instead, for the following reasons: >  Autodiscover determines the best endpoint for a given user (the endpoint that is closest to the user's Mailbox server). >  The EWS URL might change if new Client Access servers are deployed. In this scenario, using [Autodiscover](autodiscover-for-exchange.md) means no code changes are necessary. >  You should either set the URL explicitly or call **AutodiscoverUrl**, but you should not do both.
