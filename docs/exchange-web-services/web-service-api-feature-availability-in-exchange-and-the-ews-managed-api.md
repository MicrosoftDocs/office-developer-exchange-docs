# Web service API feature availability in Exchange and the EWS Managed API

Learn about which EWS and web service API features are available in each version of Exchange and the EWS Managed API.
  
Exchange client applications often target many versions of Exchange. For this reason, you might want to design your application such that you can turn [EWS client features](ews-client-design-overview-for-exchange.md#EWSFeatures) on and off based on the version of Exchange that hosts your users' mailbox. This article provides information about which service API features are available in different versions of Exchange and the EWS Managed API. Use this information to design your application to apply broadly to customers running multiple versions of Exchange. 
  
For detailed information about the differences between versions of Exchange, review the EWS schema files and the associated [reference documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6c969133-6036-448b-af39-a3caf9917e98%28Office.15%29.aspx).
  
## API features by Exchange version
<a name="bk_apifeatures"> </a>

The Exchange web service APIs, including EWS and Autodiscover, are developed with multi-version compatibility in mind. Therefore, an application that targets Exchange 2007 also works against versions of Exchange starting with Exchange 2013, including Exchange Online and Exchange Online as part of Office 365. 
  
The following table indicates which API features are available in each version of Exchange and versions of the EWS Managed API starting with version 2.0. Because your application might target multiple versions of Exchange, it will be helpful for you to know which versions support the features that your client implements. You can use the Autodiscover service to discover which version of Exchange a client targets for a user so that you can turn features on and off depending on whether they are available to your users.
