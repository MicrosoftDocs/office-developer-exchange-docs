# Delete attachments by using EWS in Exchange

Learn how to delete attachments from items by using the EWS Managed API or EWS in Exchange.
  
You have a number of options when it comes to deleting file and item attachments from items by using the EWS Managed API. You can delete all the attachments from the message, delete by a file name, or delete by position in the collection. For each of these options, there is an [AttachmentCollection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.attachmentcollection%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method. 
  
Conversely, with EWS, no matter whether you're deleting all attachments from an item or just one, the sequence of operations is same. Unlike the EWS Managed API, EWS does not include separate operations to delete based on name or position in the attachments array.
  
**Table 1. EWS Managed API methods and EWS operations for deleting attachments**

## Delete all attachments from an email by using the EWS Managed API
<a name="bk_deleteattachewsma"> </a>

The following code example shows how to delete all attachments from an email by:
  
1. Using the [EmailMessage.Bind](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.emailmessage.bind%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method to bind to an existing email message and retrieve the collection of [Attachments](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.item.attachments%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx).
    
2. Using the [AttachmentCollection.Clear](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.attachmentcollection.clear%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method to delete all the attachments from the email. 
    
3. Using the [EmailMessage.Update](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.emailmessage.update%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method to save the changes. 
    
This example assumes that **service** is a valid [ExchangeService](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object, **itemId** is the [ItemId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.itemid%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) of the message from which attachments will be deleted, and that the user has been authenticated to an Exchange server. 
  
```cs
public static void DeleteAllAttachments(ExchangeService service, ItemId itemId)
{
    // Bind to an existing message by using its item ID and requesting its attachments collection.
    // This method results in a GetItem call to EWS.
    EmailMessage message = EmailMessage.Bind(service, itemId, new PropertySet(ItemSchema.Attachments));
    // Delete all attachments from the message.
    message.Attachments.Clear();
    // Save the updated message.
    // This method results in an DeleteAttachment call to EWS.
    message.Update(ConflictResolutionMode.AlwaysOverwrite);
}
```

## Delete an attachment by name from an email by using the EWS Managed API
<a name="bk_deleteattachewsma"> </a>

The following code example shows how delete an attachment by name by:
  
1. Using the [EmailMessage.Bind](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.emailmessage.bind%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method to bind to an existing email message and retrieve the collection of [Attachments](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.item.attachments%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx).
    
2. Using the [AttachmentCollection.Remove](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.attachmentcollection.remove%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method to delete an attachment named FileAttachment.txt. 
    
3. Using the [EmailMessage.Update](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.emailmessage.update%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method to save the changes. 
    
This example assumes that **service** is a valid [ExchangeService](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object, **itemId** is the [ItemId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.itemid%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) of the message from which the attachment will be deleted, and that the user has been authenticated to an Exchange server. 
  
```cs
public static void DeleteNamedAttachments(ExchangeService service, ItemId itemId)
{
    // Bind to an existing message by using its item ID and requesting its attachments collection.
    // This method results in a GetItem call to EWS.
    EmailMessage message = EmailMessage.Bind(service, itemId, new PropertySet(ItemSchema.Attachments));
    // Iterate through the attachments collection and delete the attachment named "FileAttachment.txt," if it exists.
    foreach (Attachment attachment in message.Attachments)
    {
        if (attachment.Name == "FileAttachment.txt")
        {
            message.Attachments.Remove(attachment);
            break;
        }
    }
    // Save the updated message.
    // This method results in an DeleteAttachment call to EWS.
    message.Update(ConflictResolutionMode.AlwaysOverwrite);
}
```

## Delete attachments by position by using the EWS Managed API
<a name="bk_deleteattachewsma"> </a>

The following code example shows how to delete an attachment by position by:
  
1. Using the [EmailMessage.Bind](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.emailmessage.bind%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method to bind to an existing email message and retrieve the collection of [Attachments](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.item.attachments%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) and the [EmailMessage.HasAttachments](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.item.hasattachments%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) property. 
    
2. Using the [AttachmentCollection.Remove](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.attachmentcollection.remove%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method to delete the first attachment in the collection. 
    
3. Using the [EmailMessage.Update](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.emailmessage.update%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) method to save the changes. 
    
This example assumes that **service** is a valid [ExchangeService](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object, **itemId** is the [ItemId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.itemid%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) of the message from which the attachment will be deleted, and that the user has been authenticated to an Exchange server. 
  
```cs
public static void DeleteAttachmentByPosition(ExchangeService service, ItemId itemId)
{
    // Bind to an existing message by using its item ID and requesting the HasAttachments property and the attachments collection.
    // This method results in a GetItem call to EWS.
    EmailMessage message = EmailMessage.Bind(service, itemId, new PropertySet(EmailMessageSchema.HasAttachments, ItemSchema.Attachments));
    // Remove attachments using the zero-based index position of the attachment in the attachments collection.
    if (message.HasAttachments)
    {
        message.Attachments.RemoveAt(0);
    }
    // Save the updated message.
    // This method results in an DeleteAttachment call to EWS.
    message.Update(ConflictResolutionMode.AlwaysOverwrite);
}
```

## Delete attachments from an item by using EWS
<a name="bk_deleteattachewsma"> </a>

To delete attachments by using EWS, you first need to retrieve the message and the attachment collection to determine the [AttachmentId (GetAttachment and DeleteAttachment)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4bea1cb5-0a0f-4e14-9b09-f91af8cf9899%28Office.15%29.aspx) of the attachment to delete. After you have one or more **AttachmentId** values to delete, call the [DeleteAttachment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4d48e595-b98c-48e7-bbeb-cacf91d12a78%28Office.15%29.aspx) operation to remove the specified attachments from the message. 
  
The following code example shows how to use the [GetItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e8492e3b-1c8d-4b14-8070-9530f8306edd%28Office.15%29.aspx) operation to get an email message and the collection of attachments on the message. This is also the first XML request that the EWS Managed API sends when you use the EWS Managed API to [delete all attachments from an email](#bk_deleteattachewsma). The values of some attributes are shortened for readability.

After you determine which attachment to delete, call the [DeleteAttachment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4d48e595-b98c-48e7-bbeb-cacf91d12a78%28Office.15%29.aspx) operation and include the **AttachmentId** values of the attachments to delete.
