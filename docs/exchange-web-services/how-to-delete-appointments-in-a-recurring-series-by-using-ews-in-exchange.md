# Delete appointments in a recurring series by using EWS in Exchange

Learn how to delete appointments in a recurring series by using the EWS Managed API or EWS in Exchange.
  
You can use the EWS Managed API or EWS to delete a series of appointments or meetings, or just one instance in the series. The process you use to delete an entire series is essentially the same as the process you use to delete just a single occurrence. You use the same EWS Managed API methods or EWS operations that you use to [delete a single instance appointment or meeting](how-to-delete-appointments-and-cancel-meetings-by-using-ews-in-exchange.md). The difference is in the item ID that is included in the method or operation. Let's start by looking at how both scenarios are the same.
  
In order to delete a recurring series or a single occurrence in a recurring series, you need to find the occurrence or series that you want to delete, and then call the appropriate method or operation to remove it. While you can simply delete any type of appointment, we recommend that you keep any attendees or the organizer up to date and cancel meetings that the user has organized and decline meetings that the user did not organize.
  
So how are the scenarios different? It's all about the [Appointment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.appointment%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object used to invoke the method (for the EWS Managed API) or the item ID included in the operation request (for EWS). To delete an entire series, you need the **Appointment** object or item ID for the recurring master. To delete a single occurrence, you need the **Appointment** object or item ID for the occurrence.
  
## Delete a recurring appointment by using the EWS Managed API

This example assumes that you have authenticated to an Exchange server and have acquired an [ExchangeService](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.exchangeservice%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) object named **service**. The _recurringItem_ parameter is an **Appointment** object for either the recurring master or a single occurrence. The _deleteEntireSeries_ parameter indicates whether to delete the entire series that the _recurringItem_ is a part of.
  
```cs
public static bool DeleteRecurringItem(ExchangeService service, Appointment recurringItem, bool deleteEntireSeries)
{
    Appointment appointmentToDelete = null;
    // If the item is a single appointment, fail.
    if (recurringItem.AppointmentType == AppointmentType.Single)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("ERROR: The item to delete is not part of a recurring series.");
        return false;
    }
    // Check the Appointment that was passed. Is it
    // an occurrence or the recurring master?
    if (recurringItem.AppointmentType == AppointmentType.RecurringMaster)
    {
        if (!deleteEntireSeries)
        {
            // The item is the recurring master, so deleting it will delete
            // the entire series. The caller indicated that the entire series
            // should not be deleted, so fail.
            Console.WriteLine("ERROR: The item to delete is the recurring master of the series. Deleting it will delete the entire series.");
            return false;
        }
        else
        {
            appointmentToDelete = recurringItem;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        if (deleteEntireSeries)
        {
            // The item passed is not the recurring master, but the caller
            // wants to delete the entire series. Bind to the recurring
            // master to delete it.
            try
            {
                appointmentToDelete = Appointment.BindToRecurringMaster(service, recurringItem.Id);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("ERROR: {0}", ex.Message);
                return false;
            }
        }
        else
        {
            // The item passed is not the recurring master, but the caller
            // only wants to delete the occurrence, so just
            // delete the passed item.
            appointmentToDelete = recurringItem;
        }
    }
    if (appointmentToDelete != null)
    {
        // Remove the item, depending on the scenario. 
        if (appointmentToDelete.IsMeeting)
        {
            CalendarActionResults results;
            // If it's a meeting and the user is the organizer, cancel it.
            // Determine this by testing the AppointmentState bitmask for 
            // the presence of the second bit. This bit indicates that the appointment
            // was received, which means that someone sent it to the user. Therefore,
            // they're not the organizer.
            int isReceived = 2;
            if ((appointmentToDelete.AppointmentState &amp; isReceived) == 0)
            {
                results = appointmentToDelete.CancelMeeting("Cancelling this meeting.");
                return true;
            }
            // If it's a meeting and the user is not the organizer, decline it.
            else
            {
                results = appointmentToDelete.Decline(true);
                return true;
            }
        }
        else
        {
            // The item isn't a meeting, so just delete it.
            appointmentToDelete.Delete(DeleteMode.MoveToDeletedItems);
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

In order to use this example, you need to [bind to either an occurrence or the recurring master](how-to-access-a-recurring-series-by-using-ews-in-exchange.md), and pass the resulting **Appointment** object to the method. Keep in mind that if you access appointments by using a [CalendarView](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.calendarview%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) class, the resulting items are all single occurrences. Conversely, if you use the [ItemView](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.itemview%28v=exchg.80%29.aspx) class, the resulting items are all recurring masters.
  
## Delete a recurring appointment by using EWS

Deleting a recurring series by using EWS is the same as [deleting a single-instance meeting](how-to-delete-appointments-in-a-recurring-series-by-using-ews-in-exchange.md). In fact, the SOAP requests take the same format. Again, the key is the item ID used in the request. If the item ID corresponds to the recurring master, the entire series will be deleted. If the item ID corresponds to a single occurrence, only that occurrence will be deleted.
  
> [!NOTE]
> In the code examples that follow, the **ItemId**, **ChangeKey**, and **RecurringMasterId** attributes are shortened for readability.
  
This example uses the [CreateItem operation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/78a52120-f1d0-4ed7-8748-436e554f75b6%28Office.15%29.aspx) with a [CancelCalendarItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/a2046402-a176-44d5-b4b3-adb696581935%28Office.15%29.aspx) element to cancel a meeting for which the user is the organizer. The value of the [ReferenceItemId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8fd4bb12-a94b-43f5-be3b-f435684e311d%28Office.15%29.aspx) element indicates the item to cancel, and can be the item ID of a recurring master or a single occurrence.
  
```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
    xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages" 
    xmlns:t="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types" 
    xmlns:soap="https://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Header>
    <t:RequestServerVersion Version="Exchange2007_SP1" />
    <t:TimeZoneContext>
      <t:TimeZoneDefinition Id="Eastern Standard Time" />
    </t:TimeZoneContext>
  </soap:Header>
  <soap:Body>
    <m:CreateItem MessageDisposition="SendAndSaveCopy">
      <m:Items>
        <t:CancelCalendarItem>
          <t:ReferenceItemId Id="AAMkADA5..." ChangeKey="DwAAABYA..." />
          <t:NewBodyContent BodyType="HTML">Cancelling this meeting.</t:NewBodyContent>
        </t:CancelCalendarItem>
      </m:Items>
    </m:CreateItem>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

This example uses the **CreateItem operation** with a [DeclineItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/2d8d2389-924e-4d03-a324-35d56cf0d6b1%28Office.15%29.aspx) element to decline a meeting for which the user is not the organizer. As in the previous example, the value of the **ReferenceItemId** element indicates the item to decline, and can be the item ID of a recurring master or a single occurrence.
  
```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
    xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages" 
    xmlns:t="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types" 
    xmlns:soap="https://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Header>
    <t:RequestServerVersion Version="Exchange2007_SP1" />
    <t:TimeZoneContext>
      <t:TimeZoneDefinition Id="Eastern Standard Time" />
    </t:TimeZoneContext>
  </soap:Header>
  <soap:Body>
    <m:CreateItem MessageDisposition="SendAndSaveCopy">
      <m:Items>
        <t:DeclineItem>
          <t:ReferenceItemId Id="AAMkADA6..." ChangeKey="DwAAABYA..." />
        </t:DeclineItem>
      </m:Items>
    </m:CreateItem>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

This example uses the [DeleteItem operation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/3e26c416-fa12-476e-bfd2-5c1f4bb7b348%28Office.15%29.aspx) to delete a single occurrence of an appointment with no attendees. The occurrence to delete is specified by the [OccurrenceItemId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4a15bbc3-5b93-4193-b9ec-da32f0a9a552%28Office.15%29.aspx) element, which is constructed from the item ID of the recurring master and the index of the occurrence.
  
```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
    xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages" 
    xmlns:t="http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types" 
    xmlns:soap="https://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Header>
    <t:RequestServerVersion Version="Exchange2007_SP1" />
    <t:TimeZoneContext>
      <t:TimeZoneDefinition Id="Eastern Standard Time" />
    </t:TimeZoneContext>
  </soap:Header>
  <soap:Body>
    <m:DeleteItem DeleteType="MoveToDeletedItems" SendMeetingCancellations="SendToAllAndSaveCopy">
      <m:ItemIds>
        <t:OccurrenceItemId RecurringMasterId="AAMkADA8..." InstanceIndex="3" />
      </m:ItemIds>
    </m:DeleteItem>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

Note that you can get the same result by replacing the **OccurrenceItemId** element with an [ItemId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/3350b597-57a0-4961-8f44-8624946719b4%28Office.15%29.aspx) element that contains the item ID of the occurrence, as shown.
  
```XML
<m:ItemIds>
  <t:ItemId Id="AAMkADA7..." ChangeKey="DwAAABYA..." />
</m:ItemIds>

```
